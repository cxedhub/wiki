<h1><strong>Welcome, Educators!</strong></h1>
<p>Whether you’ve landed here through a recommendation or a search for quality computing-related educational resources—welcome! We’re so glad you found us.</p>
<p>We’re Drs. Andrea and Mike Borowczak, and for the past 15 years we’ve been designing meaningful experiences and professional learning opportunities for educators like you and student as well—across K–12 and higher education. Our work lives at the intersection of <strong>Computing + X</strong>, where <strong>X</strong> represents your core teaching area—be it language arts, math, science, social studies, or beyond.</p>
<p>What makes our approach unique? We understand that educators are already balancing full plates. That’s why our model is different from traditional professional development. Instead of adding “one more thing,” we focus on <strong>integration, differentiation, and extension</strong>—empowering you to embed computing concepts into your existing curriculum in ways that are sustainable, flexible, and impactful.</p>
<p>No matter your comfort level with computing—from complete beginner to seasoned expert—our resources are designed to meet you where you are and help you grow with confidence.</p>
<p>On this site, you’ll find:</p>
