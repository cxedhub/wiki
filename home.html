<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>If you've found this site either you've been searching for or been told about the computing-related education resources we have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of how you got here - we're thrilled you found us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drs. Andrea and Mike Borowczak have been developing engagements and opportunities for educators to gain experience, confidence, and knowledge (pedagogical and content) at the intersection of Computing+X where X is an educators primary core content/competency area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our model for engagement departs from most professional developments and focuses on providing opportunities for educators of any computing skill/prior experience level - from novice to expert - to start from where they are and grow. Additionally, Andrea and Mike build and focus on strategies and opportunities for educators that don't require “adding one more thing” to educators already overflowing plate and rather they focus on techniques for integration, differentiation, and extension can provide opportunities for teachers to build, sustain, and extend their engagement with their students.</p>
<p>On this site you'll find videos series of prior professional developments, upcoming opportunities for professional development, over 300+ computing resources created for educators spanning many different levels (K-12) and content areas (language arts, mathematics, science, social studies), and you'll find a space to request us to create/develop PDs for your school or district.</p>
<p>Explore - share - and come back often.</p>
