# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will participate in a community building activity that will integrate Computer Science through the use of the software/Key Note and hardware/iPad. The students will populate an Instagram looking graphic organizer* with a photo of a peer that matches the given criteria such as| Find someone who| walked to school today, is wearing same colored shirt as you, and is the oldest in the family * edited the original which was created by Travis Pearson, Central High School English Teacher
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre: In whole group, students will share out what they know and want to learn (KWL chart) about Instagram, Key Note program, taking appropriate versus inappropriate photos of others for an Instagram platform as shared. 


Post: Second grade/third grade students will submit completed Key Note project to canvas, then return to homeroom class. First grade will air drop their completed Key Note project to teacher. This uploaded document will be used as an assessment. Those students above will gather in homeroom and complete the learn section of the KWL chart. If time allows, share uploaded Key Note’s with class during this KWL chart time. This will be used as an informal assessment. (Also the Wrap-up)
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to utilize an iPad and Key Note software to populate provided slides with a photo of a peer based upon a given criteria. 


Students will be able to practice grade-level appropriate behaviors and responsibilities while participating in collaborative conversations.


## CATCH/HOOK
Teacher shares the Teacher Instagram pre-populated 
Key Note. See the Empty Key Note slides and populate these with teachers from your school to create a stronger connection and hook for your personal classroom setting.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
In whole group, students will share out what they know and want to learn (KWL chart) about Instagram, Key Note program, taking appropriate versus inappropriate photos of others for an Instagram platform as shared. 


Post I can statements: 
o I can use my iPad and the Key Note program to upload photos of peers based upon a given criteria. 
o I can use grade-level appropriate behaviors and responsibilities while participating in an online community. 


Teach students responsible behaviors (how to be safe, be responsible, be respectful) when using iPads, taking appropriate photos of friends (what is acceptable and unacceptable), how students will be grouped (first round: pair third grade class with the other second or third grade class, second round: pair third or second grade class with a first grade class) 


Round one: Third/second grade teachers will have students access the third grade Key Note through canvas app. They will edit their name into the Key Note Instagram program. 


Students will all relocate to an open area such as the gym or library and populate Key Note slide with photos of peers who match the prompt given per slide. Teachers will touch base with students: reinforcing appropriate introductions to each other before asking for a photo, taking appropriate photos, and providing a positive parting comment before moving onto the next peer.
