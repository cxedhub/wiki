# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson the students will be introduced to the website MakeCode with programing the microbit simulator. To start off, the students will start with the first tutorial called Flashing Heart. They can progress once each tutorial is completed. Those students who need extra support can work at their own pace.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the name of the 2 basic starting blocks used? What is a simulator? What will the simulator do with the On Start block?
What will the simulator do with the Forever block? What if the code doesn't work?
## OBJECTIVES
Complete the tutorials of Make a Heart and Name Tag individually or with support.


## CATCH/HOOK
The hook for this lesson would be showing the students the Microbit device with a programmed code that says Hello.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1.        Teacher will display the physical Microchip with the word, 'hello' scrolling through. Teacher will collect Notice and Wonder thoughts from the students and write them on a chart paper.
2.        Administer Pre Test-Teacher asks students the questions mentioned above. If students know the answer they can show thumbs up or thumbs down if they don't know it.
3.        The students will follow along on their device (iPad) while the teacher displays the website: MakeCode.microbit.org on the smartboard.
4.        The students will complete the first two tutorials called Make a Heart and Name Tag.
5.        If the tutorials are completed, students can continue through the rest of the tutorials.
6.        Post Assessment Review for the lesson/activity (e.g., wrap-up):
