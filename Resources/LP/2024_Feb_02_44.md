# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be able to use the Scratch Jr. programming blocks to make animated stories and interactive projects that focus on how plants grow.  They will explore coding and computational thinking practices as they use the Scratch Jr. app.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are the things plants need to grow?
What coding blocks will help you create a scene with a plant or tree character to their project as well as some other objects that their plant/tree needs to grow?
## OBJECTIVES
Converse County Science Content Standards:


Science 2.2: Students will conduct investigations to determine what plants and animals need to grow and how they are interdependent.




Wyoming Computer Science Content Standards


Algorithms and Programming


2.AP.A.01  With guidance, identify and model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (sets of step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks (e.g., verbally, kinesthetically, with robot devices, or a
programming language).


2.AP.C.01  With guidance, independently and collaboratively create programs to accomplish tasks using a programming language, robot device, or unplugged activity that includes sequencing, conditionals, and repetition.


## CATCH/HOOK
If you could grow anything in your garden, what would you grow?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Zip, Zap, Zop (10 Minutes)
Have everyone stand in a circle for a game of “Zip, Zap, Zop.” 
Have the whole group repeat those three words in order a few times. Zip. Zap. Zop.
Tell the group that you have a bolt of energy in your hands. To start the game, send the bolt out of your hands with a strong forward motion straight to someone else in the circle and say, “Zip.” Be sure you make eye contact with the person you pass it to.
Now it’s that person’s turn to immediately send the bolt of energy to someone else by saying, “Zap,” using the same forward moving hand motion and eye contact.
The third person passes it on with a “Zop,” to someone else in the circle.
The game continues in that order, “Zip, Zap, Zop,” until there is a mistake.
Play for as many rounds as time allows




This game will get children active and helps to reinforce the computational thinking concept of events; one thing causing another thing to happen. 




Model and have the group follow along as you explore how to use the Grow, Shrink, First, ask students what they think each block will do. Start on Tap, Wait, and Message Sending blocks within Scratch Jr. by dragging each of them into the programming area and discovering what they do. 
Then give children some free time to openly explore the app on their own. Give children opportunities to share any new and exciting discoveries with the group.
Watch the 11-minute Nature Cat episode, “Ze Worm Whisperer,” and have the group pay attention to how Nature Cat and his friends help prepare the garden to help Daisy’s plants grow.  
          https://pbskids.org/learn/scratchjr/activities/how-plants-grow


Students will have 30 minutes to make their own plant growing projects on their Chromebooks.  First, work as a group to create a list of all the things plants need to grow on the board.
Encourage everyone to add a plant or tree character to their project as well as some other objects that their plant/tree needs to grow.




Students will share with a partner to check out each other's projects. Encourage them to explore which programming blocks their partner used and why. Additionally, continue to model and encourage the giving and receiving feedback. Is there anything they would change about their project after seeing their partner’s project?

## REVIEW
An educator would review this lesson with students by discussing the blocks used in Scratch Jr.
