# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use Scratch to create a multi-level maze. Students will program a main sprite, obstacles and a goal, which level changes. Students will provide feedback to peers and redesign or improve their game based on the feedback
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you create a working digital maze game?
## OBJECTIVES
Use Events. Use Loops. Use Conditionals.


## CATCH/HOOK
Let's code a video game!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be able toâ€¦
Use a design process to follow guidelines.
Will add different components by following a checklist
Run activity to check for debugging opportunities.
Share the final product with class.

## REVIEW
Play their maze, notice what doesn't work. Then have them create another digital game.
