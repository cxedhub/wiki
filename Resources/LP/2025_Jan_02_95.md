# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be able to experiment with micro-bits. Then students will be able to create the code for taking a temperature. Students can test their micro-bit.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is â€œweather?
How do we know what the weather will be like?
What tool tells us the temperature?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will explore micro-bits
Students will be introduced to the micro:bit and how it can code certain things


## CATCH/HOOK
Video on how to be a weather watcher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo8lbeVVb4M


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Show video on how to be a weather watcher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo8lbeVVb4M


2. Show micro:bit and explain to the students what it is. Explain that this little thing is going to tell us the temperature outside and inside.


3. Show video on thermometer with microbit: https://www.google.com/search?q=explaing+microbit+thermometer+to+students&source=lmns&bih=649&biw=1366&rlz=1CAGWKK_enUS960&hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigkJeQncLxAhWFRawKHbl5BuEQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA


4. Explain that the class will be taking the temperature inside and outside
