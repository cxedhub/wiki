# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using Astronomical Units, students will program and use a Micro:bit to measure the AU distances to the scale of their steps.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How are distances in space measured?
## OBJECTIVES
Explain what an Astronomical Unit represents. Program the Micro:bit to count each step and signal when a milestone (planet) is reached.


## CATCH/HOOK
It would take you 12 years to travel in a spaceship to Neptune!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Code Micro:bit to use the On Shake input to record each step. Use the Show String Block to announce when a milestone is reached. See attached document for detailed procedure.

## REVIEW
What surprised you? Were planets closer or further away than you expected?
