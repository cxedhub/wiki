# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In todays lesson we will be exploring internet privacy and security.Students learn how to protect personal information and gain a deeper understanding of their data privacy rights so they can advocate for themselves and others.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DX5Ufkl6QO6DThV8GE7OqBvVaiDeEQgSn75crcK-LGI/edit
We will be using the post test that is provided by Code.org
## OBJECTIVES
Define the term 'password' and describe a password's purpose.
Practice creating a memorable and strong password.


## CATCH/HOOK
https://www.digitalpassport.org/password-protect.html
We will start out with this game that they can do individually or with a partner. It will lead us unto the lesson for today.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Start of the lesson: 
Distribute If ... Then Scenarios Student Handout. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JeZtFU6hMFTYITAAPaA_CRmOVknvkcKZQszL6u7DRG4/edit)  Tell students that they will be doing a jigsaw activity to understand WHY passwords are important.


Divide the class into five groups and tell students this is their 'home' group. Call on a student to read the handout directions aloud. (Slide 6)


Assign each group one of the scenarios from the handout. Allow groups to work for five to seven minutes.


Re-divide the class into new groups so that each group includes at least one student from each scenario (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). If necessary, there can be more than one person from a particular 'home' group in an 'expert' group. Allow five to seven minutes for each 'expert' to present while the rest of the group takes notes. (Slide 6)


Reconvene and ask: Based on these scenarios, why do you think it's important to have a strong password? Take turns sharing your idea with your partner. Allow one minute to pair-share.


Invite students to share out their answers. If necessary, prompt students to refer directly to the scenarios and to the consequences that would happen if someone's password was compromised. Examples could include loss of money, people knowing your private information, identity theft, and other unknown future consequences.




Create: Power Up Your Password (10 minutes)
Say: The consequences we just talked about might seem scary. But there is something you can do to make sure no one can ever guess your password. Here are some important steps to power up your password.


Distribute and project the Power Up Your Password Student Handout. Say: One way to make a strong password is to start with a memorable phrase. A phrase is a group of words that go together and are easy to remember. We're going to do a practice round together using the phrase 'There's no way I'm kissing a frog.' So we've already completed step one, which is to come up with a phrase. (Slide 7)


Invite a student to read step two. Ask: What word would our example phrase make? Invite a student to answer and add 'tnwikaf' on the projected handout.


Repeat steps three through five: reading the step aloud, calling on students to answer, and completing the 'Practice Round' section of the handout. Student answers will vary as students will choose to capitalize different letters and insert different numbers. If necessary, clarify that students can insert numbers anywhere in the password.


Say: Now you will follow these steps to come up with a password of your own. Work independently to complete the 'Your Turn' section of the handout. Allow students five minutes to complete the handout.

## REVIEW
Wrap Up: Password Tips Notes (5 minutes)
Project the Password Tips and read each one aloud. Direct students to fill in the blanks on their handout as you read them. For the last tip, clarify that a symbol is a character other than a number or letter, such as #, !, or @. (Slide 8)


Say: As you get older, having a strong password will become even more important. Passwords will help you protect your social networking profiles when you are in high school, keep your grades private when you are in college, and protect your bank accounts and online store accounts when you are an adult.
