# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson students will use the microbit to develop volcanic eruptions.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Which spheres interact when volcanoes erupt?
How can you use a microbit to program an eruption?
## OBJECTIVES
I can understand the interactions of earth's spheres
I can use computational thinking to program an eruption.
I can write an essay explaining how volcanic eruptions involve interactions of earth's spheres.


## CATCH/HOOK
Create a volcano in a cup using baking soda and vinegar.  Then challenge students to use the microbit to create a digital eruption.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
We have been learning about earth's spheres and their interactions. I will create a volcanic reaction in a cup using baking soda and vinegar.  Once their interest is peaked- I will ask them Which spheres interact when volcanoes erupt? And How can you use a microbit to program an eruption?


Students will then discuss with their team how the spheres interact.  I will then direct them to the microbits website where they can follow the steps to create a digital eruption.


Once they finish, they will write an essay about how earthâ€™s spheres interact when volcanoes erupt.

## REVIEW
Students can read each other's essays and view their digital eruptions. Students can discus what went well and where they struggled.
