# Lesson Plan
## Overview
To start students will learn to code with a deck of cards and manipulatives. Students will have jobs such as the programmer, tester, and the bot. They will physically move an object through programming language.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is coding language?
2. How do I follow an algorithm?
3. How can I teach another student to follow the instructions from start to finish?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students are able to understand coding language. 
2. Students are able to follow an algorithm and set of simple instructions to complete a task. 
3. 5th grade students are able to give simple instructions to K students.


## CATCH/HOOK
Can you reach your desired destination on a 7 x7 grid using an algorithm? If you can, you are rewarded with the prize! Learning to follow instructions and algorithms are key to helping you succeed!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Materials:


Deck of Cards
Painter's Tape
Variety of small toys
The Bots
Prizes
Job Cards


Part 1 Instructions:


1. Set up a 7x7 grid of playing cards and fix them to the floor. 
2. Take smaller toys and place them randomly on the cards. 
3. Take prize and place on one of the cards. 
4. Place the bots in the starting position. 
5. Assign and select the job (programmer, tester, bot)
6. The Programmer will write a set of instructions to get to the prize such as 'Move forward 7 cards, etc'
8. The Tester will give instructions to the Bot.
9. After each instruction, the bot will move based on the instructions given to get to the prize. 


Older students will begin as programmers and testers to show the younger students how it works. Eventually the younger students will take over as programmer with help of an older student. 


Part 2 Instructions:


When the activity has finished, student will be given a printable grid, The Frog Pond. 


1. Students create a series of commands that move the frog across the ponds. Print/make 5 different ponds. 
2. Cut out command cards and place in order of algorithm sequence desired. 
3. One student will then move the frog across the pond based on the algorithm to the finish. 


Printable materials are found on Teacher Pay Teacher. 


Part 3 Extension Instructions:


1. Students will take what they have learned and apply to code.org activities.

## REVIEW
Were they able to obtain the prize in Part 1?
Where they able to problem solve?
What their pond grid activity successful?
