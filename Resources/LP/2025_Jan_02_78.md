title: Half Life Radioactive Decay with Micro|bits
description: Introduce basic programming of the micro|bit while reiterating the integration of math in physical science exploring half life radioactive decay. Will calculate starting mass, ending mass or half life but the limitations on half life include 1 or 2 half lives only. Without the use of logarithms on micro|bits, solving for an unknown exponent is not possible.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Introduce basic programming of the micro|bit while reiterating the integration of math in physical science exploring half life radioactive decay. Will calculate starting mass, ending mass or half life but the limitations on half life include 1 or 2 half lives only. Without the use of logarithms on micro|bits, solving for an unknown exponent is not possible.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a micro:bit? How is it programmed? How does the micro:bit compare to a calculator in solving half life problems?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Introduction of micro:bits and programming them.
2. Compare systems of a micro:bit to a calculator for computations.
3. Create problems to test on both devices.
4. *Optional/Differentiated* - Allow students to find the limitations of the half life program.


## CATCH/HOOK
Present a problem where students have to decide which tool to use and why. Dig a hole=shovel, Drive a nail=hammer, Insert a screw=screwdriver. Then give them a problem without a specific tool for that job. Break a stick (Hammer, shovel, or screwdriver). Present this as a challenge to solve half life problem with a calculator or micro:bit.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will log onto classroom micro:bit. They will be provided with a template where they will have to organize and complete to get the program to work. This will introduce the basics of micro:bit programming without having students struggle too much with writing a program. Once tested, they will load it onto the micro:bit and use it to answer 6 basic questions on half life. Each group will need to provide an additional three questions of their own that they can use the micro:bit program to answer. They will record these on their assignment. **Differentiation** To avoid struggling groups from being bogged down by the programming element, I will have a picture of what the correct program should look like. This will be given to the students at about 20 minutes into the programming. For higher achievers, there task will be to find the limitations of the program and figure out what problems it will not solve correctly. Additionally, they can compare the micro:bit programming with the Python or JavaScript programming and compare the coding.

## REVIEW
Revisit the question again, which tool is write for the job? Students will write what they think was best for the calculating of half life problems. This should lead us into a discussion of comparing computing systems. Additionally, we will review the scientific concept of half life and evaluate their success.
