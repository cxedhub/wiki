# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will begin the year of computer science by talking about how the people in their lives use different types of technology.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do the people around you use technology?
## OBJECTIVES
identify how they use technology each day
identify how an adult  of their choosing uses technology each day
create a slide show that illustrates each of the above in both words and pictures


## CATCH/HOOK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZfOVg07sys 
videos about how technology is used from the perspective of kids.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will watch the video, then have a discussion about how they use technology in their daily lives. Using google slides students will make a slide showing the ways that they use technology each day. Then we will discuss adults in our lives and the different ways that they use technology. Students will create another slide illustrating how an adult in their life uses technology. Students will also discuss the pros and cons of technology and list  2 on each side of slide 3.
