# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using data gained from an article and a simulation, students will determine whether or not the Glaciers of Glacier National Park are shrinking, and predict the future of the glaciers.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1.  Are the glaciers in Glacier National Park changing size?
2.  What is your evidence for the claim you made in question 2? (Be sure to use observations and measurements)
3.  How do glaciers weather and erode the ground they cover?
## OBJECTIVES
1.  Identify the phenomenon they are investigating.
2.  Identify the evidence to determine whether or not the glaciers in Glacier National Park are shrinking.
3.  Make observations to provide evidence of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation.
4.  Make measurements to provide evidence of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation.
5.  Use data to highlight and propose relationships, predict outcomes, or communicate an idea.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students are shown two pictures of the Grinnell Glacier - one from 1938 and one from 2019.  They are asked to write down three things that they notice and three things that they wonder about what they are seeing.  Students will notice that, besides the fact that one photograph is in color, and one is in color, the size of the glaciers is shrinking


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will use data from an article about glaciers, and a simulation to determine why the glaciers are getting smaller.  See attached handout.
