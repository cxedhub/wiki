# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Program and use a Micro:bit 'Coin Flipper' to illustrate probability.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you program a Micro:bit to show heads or tales?
Describe the probability for landing on each.
## OBJECTIVES
Program the Micro:bit to generate a random image from a set of two.(eg heads or tails).


## CATCH/HOOK
The first coins were found in Turkey.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Hook Question: Flip a coin and ask what the chances are for landing on heads.
2. Describe the project.
3. Code the flip generator.
4. Test
5. Run and record results.
6. Analyze data to see probability at work.

## REVIEW
We have coded a random 'flipper' and recorded the results. What result did you expect? Were there any surprises when comparing that to what actually happened?
