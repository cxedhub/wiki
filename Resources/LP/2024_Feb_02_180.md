# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Use the micro:bit as a step counter to measure and mark the planets' relative distances from the Sun.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an astronomical unit?
What event causes the Microbit to count steps?
## OBJECTIVES
Program the Microbit to record steps.
Describe the meaning astronomical unit.
Move and mark planets' relative distances from the Sun.


## CATCH/HOOK
It would take 12 years to travel to Neptune in a spaceship.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Code Micro:bit to use the On Shake input to record each step.
Use the Show String Block to announce when a milestone is reached.
See attached document for detailed procedure.
