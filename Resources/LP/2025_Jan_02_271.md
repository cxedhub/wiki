# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Designed for students learning Java programming, that are beyond the use of block code, the students will make a program that uses a for loop and be able to explain what each component of the for loop does and the syntax of the for loop in Java.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a for loop? What are the components and syntax of a for loop in the Java programming language?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to write a program in the Java language that uses a for loop and explain the critical components/syntax of this type of loop.


## CATCH/HOOK
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwcisLY5avc (8 minute video)


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Reiterate what the for loop is. Show slide that is attached. Students will follow along with teacher to code a simple program. Photo of the program is attached. Everyone will try to run their programs and classmates will help each other to debug when problems arise.

## REVIEW
Revisit the Java syntax and then use www.w3schools.com to compare the syntax of a for loop for a couple of other programming languages.
