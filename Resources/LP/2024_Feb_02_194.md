# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Online Authentication often revolves around passwords. We will discuss how to develop simple rules to create strong passwords. These rules are scalable and can be used for all websites to achieve desired password strength.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre: 
1) What is authentication?
2) What are the consequences of losing your password?
3) Where do you find authentication rules set by websites?
## OBJECTIVES
Identify the meaning and purpose of authentication. Discover the authentication rules set by the website administrator. Develop an easy to remember, personal strategy that can grow as they grow.


## CATCH/HOOK
We all understand how locks protect us and our property. If everyone had the keys then everyone would be able to gain access to our lockers, homes and even ride off with our bikes! Internet passwords protect our online selves the same way. Just as physical locks must be strong, our online passwords must also be strong. And, just as we keep our keys in an easy to remember location, our passwords must also be easy to remember.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
(10min) Discuss what authentication means and how it is used. 
Resource found here: https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2
1) Students start by identifying what they think makes a password strong. Then, they compare it to the do's and don'ts in the resource.
2) The students independently write down 3 categories that they find easy to remember; like favorite food, cartoon, sport, etc.
3) Finally, the students use these facts to create a strong password and test it in the game described in the resource.

## REVIEW
Review (10mins)
Authentication
What is it?
Authentication is how we show something is true.
What are some examples of personal authentication?
Passwords
Identity Document (ex: Birth Certificate, Driverâ€™s License)
Personal Identifiable Information (Birthday, birth location, family names)
Unique Physical Traits (fingerprints, photo)
Passwords
Why do we use passwords online?
What makes a password strong?
How can we make our passwords easy to remember?
