# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Explaining what algorithms are and how computers use them.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm?
How do algorithms help us?
Why do computers need algorithms?
## OBJECTIVES
Define what an algorithm is
How we use algorithms in daily tasks
Understand why computers need algorithms


## CATCH/HOOK
See a finished origami, or See a computer using an algorithm to complete a task


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Through this activity students will see what an algorithm is, why computers need them to know what to do and how they are apart of our daily tasks.
