# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
This is an unplugged activity where students will design an application for a cell phone or personal device to solve a problem that exists in 'their world'.  The created application should be unique in design and resolution. Simply put, this application should not be a duplication of one already on the market today.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is an unplugged activity where students will design an application for a cell phone or personal device to solve a problem that exists in 'their world'.  The created application should be unique in design and resolution. Simply put, this application should not be a duplication of one already on the market today.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1 - What are the steps in the Problem Solving Process?
2 - List three forms of input and an example of the information provided?
3 - List three forms of output and an example of the information provided?
4 - What type of information should be stored in an application? Provide an example.
## OBJECTIVES
1 - identify a problem that exists in their world.
2 - collaborate with others to create an application.
3 - share their application through and oral presentation.


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine you could fix any problem in the world...what type of an application would you create on your cell phone to do this?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This is an unplugged lesson to help students apply the Problem Solving Process and collaborate with others to develop a visual representation of a cell phone or personal device application that would solve a problem that exists in their world. This activity can be a 2-3 day project. Day 1 - Problem solving brainstorming, introduction of activity and worksheet. Day 2 - Finish worksheet and create visual display and prepare for presentations. Day 3 - Presentations and wrap up. (based on 55 min class period)


*Pre-requisite lessons: Problem Solving Process, Inputs, Outputs, Storage and Processing
*Coordinate 'Sharks' for presentation day. These could include other teachers, administrators, parents, community members, etc.


Activity Steps:
1 - What are some problems that exist in your world today? (Brainstorming - anything goes)
Examples: sleep through alarm, not sure what clothes to wear, hunting and fishing boundaries for tag/license
2 - Introduce what 'Shark Tank' means: this video link for 'EZ PZ Happy Mats' is a good example of a problem and a possible resolution. Only need to watch first two minutes of video. If integrating with math curriculum, you may want to extend the video to show how cost, investment, return, markup, etc. are important concepts for their application.

3 - Divide students into small groups.
4 - Students should select a problem that they want to create an application for. (The only research is their personal knowledge--no computers or other resources.)
5 - Students should complete the attached Shark Tank Worksheet. (I recommend each student do a worksheet so they can express their thoughts and knowledge as individuals, even though this is a group project)
6 - Once worksheet is completed, students should design a visual representation of the new application. Including important elements in the design and functionality. This visual display should be used and referenced in the oral presentation.
7 - Students will have two minutes maximum to present their application to the 'Sharks'. They should be prepared to answer questions regarding all steps of the activity. 
8 - Sharks should then deliberate and award top presenters. (TBD)
*Fun awards like 100Grand bars for the winners. Extra gum for efforts. Tootsie rolls, Nerds, etc. Be creative in the award system you want to use.

## REVIEW
Some follow-up discussion:
1 - Talk about collaboration with others--pros and cons. Introduce how collaboration is a big part of computer science.
2 - Review of how computer science is problem solving.
3 - Student take-aways 3-2-1: students can tell three things they liked, two recommendations for improvement and one thing they will remember for each application.
