# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using the MicroBit students will make a safe container for an egg drop. Instead of an egg, the students will be using the microbit to sense the impact. Students will learn about force and energy transfer.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can you keep an egg from breaking?
## OBJECTIVES
Draw a model of the energy and force being used. Design and test an egg drop.


## CATCH/HOOK
Phenomenon to be determined...


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Creating a container for a safe egg drop and testing the egg drop
