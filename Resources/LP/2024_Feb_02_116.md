title: Egg Drop Experiment using Microbit
description: Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores Newton’s 2nd Law, momentum and impulse using a microprocessor.  They will study the phenomenon of gravity , -9.8 m/s2.  They will be able to calculate the force of the egg on impact and create an apparatus that increases the impulse so that the egg and Microbit do not break on impact.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores Newton’s 2nd Law, momentum and impulse using a microprocessor.  They will study the phenomenon of gravity , -9.8 m/s2.  They will be able to calculate the force of the egg on impact and create an apparatus that increases the impulse so that the egg and Microbit do not break on impact.

   + After teaching this lesson I found an Egg Drop lesson using a Microbit (makecode.microbit.org) that gave a great explanation of how to set up this experiment.  The instructor in this video talks about using the spiral method.  So, if you have time this lesson is worth looking into.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores Newton’s 2nd Law, momentum and impulse using a microprocessor.  They will study the phenomenon of gravity , -9.8 m/s2.  They will be able to calculate the force of the egg on impact and create an apparatus that increases the impulse so that the egg and Microbit do not break on impact.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1) Make a diagram the represents the g-forces as an object falls from 4-m.  
2) Find the force of an object that has a mass of 10 g and another object that has a mass of .01 kg. If both objects take 1.5 seconds to fall, determine which object has the greater impulse. 
3) Explain the purpose of an airbag in a vehicle and how does it affect impulse.
## OBJECTIVES
Students  will be able to build an apparatus that helps them understand how the gravitational forces act in a system. Students also develop an understanding that the total momentum of a system is conserved when there is no net force on the system. Students are able to use Newton’s Law of Gravity to describe and predict the gravitational forces between objects.


## CATCH/HOOK
1) Engineer an apparatus that will prevent a raw egg from breaking when dropped from a height of 4 m.
2) Why does a cell phone need an accelerometer?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will make diagram, list materials needed and build an apparatus that holds an egg and a Microbit that will be dropped from 4-m.  The Microbit should be able to record the acceleration of the falling object. The apparatus with the lightest, smallest, and most innovative containers in which the egg does not break will be awarded prizes.

## REVIEW
Have students' misconceptions from pre-test been addressed? Examples:Newton's 2nd Law, impulse, momentum, gravity, kinetic energy and potential energy.
