# Lesson Plan
## Overview
These interdisciplinary lessons encompass standards across Computer Science, Language Arts, Social Studies, and Mathematics. Students learn about maps, coordinates, and directions, then create a map. They will then challenge friends to write algorithms to help Dash navigate the neighborhood.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm?
How does sequence help us create successful algorithms?
## OBJECTIVES
Write algorithms in a correct sequence to navigate around the neighborhood.
Use algorithms and debug issues to solve the computational problems addressed.


## CATCH/HOOK
This activity opens with students first navigating a familiar story (3 Little Pigs). Story 'mats' are laid out with the robot so students see the materials--as they come in and sit down, they are asked to retell the story. Most will simply retell, but are encouraged to expand the story--asked what happens at each stage, based on what they know. Then we shift to focus on the point of view of the wolf. What he saw at each stage, how he would have acted, what he could have said. Then we start breaking down each stage as it relates to sequence, we discuss things we could add to the robot's events (sounds, lights, actions) which build out the algorithm and make for a very engaging story. This can be a very exciting opening activity as students get 'into' it and then are turned loose to write their algorithms, from the perspective of the wolf.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
There are 3 activities within this product:
1. Discuss the story of the Three Little Pigs. Ask students if they can re-tell the sequence of events from the Wolfâ€™s perspective.
2. Students work to create a neighborhood map using the Mapping our Neighborhood sheet on large pieces of craft/butcher paper. 
Then students will determine how they want viewers to navigate their neighborhood. Teams will compile the sequence (navigation directions) for visitors to utilize as they write their algorithms in Blockly for Dash to navigate the neighborhood.
3. Students share their maps and navigation directions with another group or class (visitors). Visitors work to document the algorithm that must be used to have Dash visit the town in the correct sequence outlined by the creator using the coding block manipulatives.

## REVIEW
Assessments can be based on formative work: initial understanding of algorithms in Activity 1, map work in Activity 2, then final algorithm application in Activity 3.
