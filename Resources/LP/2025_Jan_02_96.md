# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students engineered mint mobiles to race through a micro bit timing gate. The data was then collected and plotted on a number line in the form of whole numbers and fractions. The students took this data and asked/answered questions based on the collection.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can you measure the speed of an object? Can the speed of an object change based on it's design? What patterns did you see with designs? What questions can be derived from the speed data on the line plot?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object. 
Student will be able to make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions by using information presented in line plots.
Students will be able to creates a simple example of how a computing device takes input, stores information, processes input and information, and provides output


## CATCH/HOOK
Designs to change velocity of a mint mobile


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Timing Gates: Two gates are connected to the micro:bit so it can detect a car passing through them.
Timing Gates are set up
Mint Mobiles are created by students as a STEAM project
One class line plot is created on giant paper
Each student plots their car data
Students create math problems from the line plot
Students solve each otherâ€™s questions using the data

## REVIEW
Discussion Questions for Students: 
How did the design of your mint mobile affect the speed?
Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object.
Was your prediction of outcomes about the changes in energy that occur when objects collide accurate? Why or Why not?
What debugging had to take place? How did you solve these problems?
What would you do differently next time?
