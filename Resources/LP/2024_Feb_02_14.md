# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students learn about trickster tales in different cultures, then learn about how algorithms tell a story using ScratchJr. This is a multi-lesson activity that integrates with Language Arts, Social Studies and Computer Science.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm?
Describe the importance of following a sequence?
## OBJECTIVES
Identify and model daily processes by creating and following algorithms 
Create programs to accomplish task
Use algorithms to create their own trickster tale and produce using ScratchJr.


## CATCH/HOOK
Tell the story of a trickster....select a scene and have students work with you to 'write' an algorithm to retell.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students learn about trickster tales in different cultures, then learn about how algorithms tell a story using ScratchJr. This is a multi-lesson activity that integrates with Language Arts, Social Studies and Computer Science.
