# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will tell important events from their life using a Winter Counts calendar. They will use the given symbols from their calendar to play Conway's Game of Life. They will see how their symbols change as the pixels change.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do your symbols change as the pixels move on the screen?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to see patterns as the pixels change in the Game of Life.


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine telling your life story through symbols on a calendar.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be given symbols that stand for particular items. They will choose one important event from each year of their life. First, they will make a draft by drawing on a piece of paper. Next, they will paint their calendar on a paper bag to resemble a hide painting. Finally, they will choose symbols from their calendar to play Conway's Game of Life.
