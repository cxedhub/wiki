# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students are going to build their own anemometer to check the wind speeds in their hometown.  They are going to use their data to help predict the weather and see if the wind is an indicator.

+ *Considerations:*
   + We ended up using plastic cups, I think the paper cups would work better, but plastic might be more durable in the wind.  Testing them in front of fan worked really well, they were able to practice counting the rotations and be ready for the outside experiment. 


**The anemometers won't spin if they students grip the pencils too tightly, let the pencil point rest in one hand, while the other very loosely holds it, or just forms a circle around the pencil.**


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students are going to build their own anemometer to check the wind speeds in their hometown.  They are going to use their data to help predict the weather and see if the wind is an indicator.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do you measure wind speed? 
By testing the wind speed what predictions can you make about the weather the next day?
## OBJECTIVES
We will use data to make predictions and communicate ideas based on wind speeds in Wyoming.   We will build an anemometer to and test it to check wind speeds.


## CATCH/HOOK
Almost everyday, you hear someone comment (or complain:) about the wind. 
What are some things youâ€™ve heard people say about the wind in Rawlins? 
The wind is almost like a warning to us about the weather, and we are going to use wind as a tool to make predictions about our weather.

## REVIEW
Students will share their data and their presentations in a slideshow to share their knowledge of anemometers and predicting the weather.
