## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Introduction to the concept of integrity  with a video, unplugged activity, and discussion


### PRE/POST-TEST
Can data that has been compromised remain useful?
How can you make sure that a message has not been changed after being sent?
Multiple choice: Which of these objects can have degraded integrity?a. A bridge  2. A friend  3. A database 4. An orange 5. An email message 6. All of the above.


### OBJECTIVES
Describe integrity with regard to data and online behavior.
Explain how a Man in the Middle attack works.


### CATCH/HOOK
A hacker sells hacked social media account credentials for $30-$80 each.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pre-assessment (5-10 minutes): Students respond to pretest questions in a suitable manner (class discussion, response system, etc)


Introduction (10-15 minutes): Discussion question: If a bridge was used by many, many trucks each day, each carrying critical supplies (food, etc) to your community, what problems would happen if it became structurally unstable and therefore dangerous to use, preventing the trucks from making their delivery? Tie structural integrity to data integrity.


Man in the Middle unplugged (10-15 minutes): Use the old telepohone game altered to insert a third person in the middle of atwo party discussion. What happens to messages? Can you be sure that nobody else now knows what you said?


Integrity Videos and Discussion (30 minutes): View Integrity video and discuss key points. What do you question about your online actions?






### REVIEW
Exit ticket Question: Describe one thing that might happen as a result of data integrity loss.
