# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
In this lesson students will engage in discussion about whether order matters.  Students will write the steps to their favorite recipe and share out to see if they work. They will then be introduced to GEMS. Finally, students will complete the sequencing lessons on code.org.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson students will engage in discussion about whether order matters.  Students will write the steps to their favorite recipe and share out to see if they work. They will then be introduced to GEMS. Finally, students will complete the sequencing lessons on code.org.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Does the order in which you do things matter?
What is GEMS?
What is an algorithm?
## OBJECTIVES
Explain the importance of using the correct sequence.
Identify GEMS and the order of operations.
Create a sequential code.
Investigate what happens if you do not follow the correct sequence.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will hold a banana in the air- student will inquire about why I have a banana.  Once their interest is peaked- I will ask them how fast they could eat the entire banana.  Once one student is convinced, they can eat the banana the fastest, I will give them the banana and get ready to start a timer.  When they start to peel the banana- I will remind them that they said they could eat the entire banana.  This will bring in the importance of order matters.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will then write step by step directions to their favorite recipe. (Algorithm) They will get with a partner and tell the partner the steps.  Their partner will help them problem solve if steps were missed.  Then the other partner will share and they will trouble shoot again.
Once they have all had a chance to share with their partner, I will write a math problem on the board and ask them to solve it.  3+4x7.  Some students will get 49 while other students may get 31.  We will discuss with our table group which answer we think is correct.  If they all get 49, then I will type it into the google search bar which will return the answer of 31.  We will then discuss why the correct answer is 31 and write out the steps for GEMS.  Groupings, Exponents, Multiply and divide left to right, subtract and add left to right.
Students will then log onto code.org- course D sequencing and complete the lessons.

## REVIEW
Are there times when order does not matter?
Explain to your group what you learned about sequencing and what could happen if you do things out of sequence.
