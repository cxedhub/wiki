# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is meant to introduce what coding is to elementary aged students and how to use block code. Students will learn that the micro|bit is a pocket-sized computer (hardware) that has many integrated components.  Students will learn how to write a program (software) using block code that will control the lights of the LEDs on their micro|bit. They will create a flashing pattern on the micro|bit that includes a word or phrase, picture, and sound.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is a Micro:bit?
2. What is coding?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will write a program using block code  to create a flashing pattern on the micro:bit that includes a word or phrase, picture, and sound.


## CATCH/HOOK
Ask a student to go get something out of a cabinet for me from across the room.  Have a second student go get the same thing from a similar position except blind folded.  What is the difference?  They aren’t receiving all the information needed to complete the task.  Running into obstacles that weren’t there before.  Have a third student go out in the hallway and come back in and be given a set of directions to complete a task that is unknown to them but part of their daily routine. Discuss if this was easy.  Why or why not?  (Patterns, recognition, routines). What happens when you are blindfolded?  You aren’t receiving all the information.  You need step-by-step directions.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Unplugged: You will introduce what it means to use a code (a series of numbers, letters, or characters) to communicate a set of step-by-step instructions to a partner for them to complete a task.  


Plugged activity using the micro:bit-
1.        Explore the major parts of the micro:bit (LED light display, A/B buttons, sensors, etc.)
Introduction to the BBC micro:bit - YouTube
2.        Students will watch the following YouTube video to learn about LED’s on the micro:bit in order to understand how they work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqBmvHD5bCw   
3.        Introduce them to the micro:bit programming interface.
4.        Show examples of and discuss two types of code (block and text-based code such as javascript) – Which looks easier for someone their age? Have they seen either of these before? Some may have seen java script used in a movie by a computer hacker.  Do they think they could ever do that?  Why or why not?  Most likely they will say that they do not know how to type.  This will open the discussion for drag and drop and that they need to make sure and have theirs set to block.          
5.        Discuss the drag and drop concept.
6.        Create teacher guided message:  Hello! 
7.        Explore the different icons and strings (basic, on start, forever, input, melody)
8.        Students will then explore what happens when they make changes within their code.  What works and what does not.  What happens when you place things in the forever block?  
9.        Program a micro:bit to perform 3 simple tasks

## REVIEW
Bonus Activity:  Send a one worded message to a friend that will put a smile on their face.
Together, with a partner or as a group, they will discuss what they enjoyed, what was a challenge and what they would do differently next time. Also ask what they would like to learn more about in the future.
