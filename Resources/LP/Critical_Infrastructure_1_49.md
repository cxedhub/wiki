description: Students will be able to explain what Critical Infrastructure is, what are common components that belong to critical infrastructure, and what could happen if components of  Critical Infrastructure are damaged/ destroyed. Cyber security and cyber warfare will be an important part of this because I believe that is not thought of as much as physical issues (hurricanes, bombings, etc)

## OVERVIEW


### Activity Overview:  
Students will be able to explain what Critical Infrastructure is, what are common components that belong to critical infrastructure, and what could happen if components of  Critical Infrastructure are damaged/ destroyed. Cyber security and cyber warfare will be an important part of this because I believe that is not thought of as much as physical issues (hurricanes, bombings, etc)

## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will be able to explain what Critical Infrastructure is, what are common components that belong to critical infrastructure, and what could happen if components of  Critical Infrastructure are damaged/ destroyed. Cyber security and cyber warfare will be an important part of this because I believe that is not thought of as much as physical issues (hurricanes, bombings, etc)


### PRE/POST-TEST
1. How comfortable are you giving a public brief?
2. What do you think the effects of an attack and/ or destruction of CI would effect the public?  
3. What would you do to improve a defense in depth for CI?


### OBJECTIVES
1. Give a well-thought, developed, and researched brief on their chosen subject 
2. Be able to describe how Critical Infrastructure can be vulnerable, effects of an attack, etc. (Cybersecurity and Cyber warfare are included)  
3. Provide recommendations on how to provide better protections, etc


### CATCH/HOOK
This will be included in our full mission rehearsal using our emergency board


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Tasks 
●        Lecture “Introduction to Critical Infrastructure”
●        Explain and assign projects to students. Students will start giving their presentations (1) week from the date the project was assigned 


Learning Check 
●        Each student will give a 5 minute presentation on a component of Critical infrastructure to include:
○        What is it and how is it a resource?
○        How is it vulnerable? 
○        How is it protected? 
○        What are the short and long term effects if this CI is compromised (damaged or destroyed)?
○        How can some of these effects be mitigated?
