# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will learn what micro|bits are and how they can be used.  They will also learn how to code their own micro|bits.  They will start by making flashing hearts.
## Meta description
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science, Technology 
+ *Grade Level :* K-2 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Computing Systems, Networks and The Internet, Algorithms and Programming
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Developing and Using Abstractions, Creating Computational Artifacts, Testing and Refining Computational Artifacts
+ *Materials:* 
   + Website, Micro:bit, chromebook or some kind of computer or tablet
+ *Considerations:*
   + ● Foundational knowledge of block coding (maybe use of a kibo, bee bot, and/or scratch jr. before hand)
● Unplugged activities prior to the micro:bits could also be beneficial.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will learn what micro|bits are and how they can be used.  They will also learn how to code their own micro|bits.  They will start by making flashing hearts.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a micro:bit?
What do you have to do to get your micro:bit to work?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to describe what micro:bits are. 
Students will be able to code and use micro:bits.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will get to code their own projects and will understand that the first couple lessons will allow them to get to the point where they can make their own games with them.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Pre-survey to check for understanding of what micro:bits are and what you have to do to get your micro:bit to work.  
2. Introduce micro:bits and explain their use and purpose. 
3. Develop and class guidelines for using the micro:bits (organization, power, cleaning, etc) 
4. Present a basic lesson on how to use the micro:bits. Use videos in slides.
5. Have students complete the flashing heart activity as a whole group - check in with them throughout this process.

## REVIEW
Discuss what they learned about today and then have them complete the post survey.
