# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson asks students to create their own moral dilemma scenario and create possible outcomes for their scenario. Students must describe why someone would choose both outcomes and what outcome they believe to be the correct choice and why.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Students will start class with a trolly problem on the board asking them to write down their choice on a sticky note in front of them. Students will have to pick who to save out of two fairly similar groups with no obvious choice.  Students will Launch by re addressing this choice and re-answering the initial question with the promise of not including their own identified biases.
## OBJECTIVES
Students Mastery of concepts or progress towards master will be identifiable when students are able to clearly describe to you their thinking and label their own logical fallacies and cultural biases.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will start class with a trolly problem on the board asking them to write down their choice on a sticky note in front of them. Students will have to pick who to save out of two fairly similar groups with no obvious choice.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
-Engage/ Hook 5 min - Students will start class with a trolly problem on the board asking them to write down their choice on a sticky note in front of them. Students will have to pick who to save out of two fairly similar groups with no obvious choice. During attendance time students will be given 3-5 minutes to discuss their reason for the choice they made. 
-Explore/ Communicate 20 minutes - Students will be given access to the website link and explore the guided scenarios. Students will complete each scenario by making a choice between two outcomes. Students will be asked to communicate their choice for three of the scenarios by describing the scenario and why they picked the outcome they did.
-Communicate 5 min - Upon simulation completion students will be given a bar graph indicating their implicit biases identified by the machine learning. 


-Empower 10 min- students will be given the opportunity to create their own scenario and create possible outcomes for their scenario. Students must then in at least one paragraph describe why someone would choose both outcomes and what outcome they believe to be the correct choice and why.

## REVIEW
-Launch- 10 min - Students will share their scenario with a partner and be asked to verbally make a choice on their partner's scenario and share their thinking. Students must also identify the moral obligation of a computer in this situation and discuss with their partner if they think computers should be given these choices. Lastly students will revisit their sticky note from the beginning of class and re answer their trolly problem question.
