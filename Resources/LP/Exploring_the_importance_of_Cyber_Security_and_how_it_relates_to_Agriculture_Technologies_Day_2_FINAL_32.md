## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will understand the importance of cybersecurity in agricultural technologies. Students will explore the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with agricultural technologies. Students will learn strategies and best practices for ensuring cybersecurity in agricultural settings based on research from provided article resources and classroom discussion. Students will then put together a presentation to show different pieces of technology used in agriculture and show how important cyber security is to the production of food and global food security.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Completion and accuracy of individual or group reflections summarizing the importance of cybersecurity in agricultural technologies.
Understanding demonstrated through answers to questions related to cybersecurity in agriculture in class discussion and presention of their poster and their findings with the class.


### OBJECTIVES
Students will understand the importance of cybersecurity in agricultural technologies. 
Students will explore the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with agricultural technologies. 
Students will learn strategies and best practices for ensuring cybersecurity in agricultural settings.


### CATCH/HOOK
5 minute Warm Up: Review the discussions and findings from the previous class.
10 minutes - Introduce students to different strategies and best practices for ensuring cybersecurity in agricultural technologies.
Review the Cybersecurity Hand Method
Present and discuss key cybersecurity concepts and terminology relevant to agriculture, such as authentication, encryption, access control, and data privacy.
Engage students in a brainstorming session on measures that can be implemented to enhance cybersecurity in agricultural technologies.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
30 minutes - Divide the class into the same four small groups from Day 1 and assign each group a specific aspect of agricultural technology: precision agriculture, agricultural drones, IoT devices, and smart heavy machinery. 
In their groups, have students research and discuss potential cybersecurity risks and recommended security measures for the assigned aspect.
Each group will create a poster or chart paper summarizing their findings, including key risks and corresponding cybersecurity strategies, including identifying risks or protections for these technologies.






### REVIEW
5 Minute Wrap-up - Inform students that on the next class day, each group will present their poster and discuss their findings with the class.
Conclude the lesson by emphasizing the importance of ongoing awareness, training, and collaboration among farmers, technology developers, and cybersecurity experts to ensure strong cybersecurity practices in agriculture.
