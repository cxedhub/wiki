# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will become weather watchers. They will journal the weather everyday and document the temperature using the micro:bit that has already been programmed by the teacher. At the end of the week, students will create a flipgird video with a group to explain their findings.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is â€œweather?
How do we know what the weather will be like?
What tool tells us the temperature?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will observe and record weather and temperature
Students will be introduced to the micro:bit and how it can code certain things
Students will work in a group to record a video of their findings


## CATCH/HOOK
Video on how to be a weather watcher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo8lbeVVb4M


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
** Prior to this lesson, the students will have been introduced to recognizing the weather and graphing it during calendar time.
Show video on how to be a weather watcher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo8lbeVVb4M
Hand out and look through their weather journals: premade
Explain to them that there is a spot in their weather journal for temperature, but how are we going to know what the temperature is? Allow for discussion
Show micro:bit and explain to the students what it is. Explain that this little thing is going to tell us the temperature outside everyday this week.
Show video on thermometer with microbit: https://www.google.com/search?q=explaing+microbit+thermometer+to+students&source=lmns&bih=649&biw=1366&rlz=1CAGWKK_enUS960&hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwigkJeQncLxAhWFRawKHbl5BuEQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA
Explain that the class will be taking this outside everyday and recording the temperature
Start filling out DAY 1 on weather journal together
Continue this for 5 days
The following week: Have students create a video on flipgrid about what they learned

## REVIEW
When all of the students have created their videos, as a class, we will watch the videos together
