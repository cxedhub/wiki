# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This activity teaches students the importance of creating a safe and secure password. In addition, students will also get to learn how hackers or computers can hack passwords. Students will be able to create their own password using a set of guidelines. The passwords they create may be used for accessing their school computers or websites.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a password?
What are some consequences of someone finding out your password?
What should you do if someone discovers your password?
## OBJECTIVES
Define the term 'password' and describe a password's purpose.
Identify strategies for creating and protecting secure passwords
Practice creating a memorable and strong password.


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine how you protect something. What are the steps you take to protect that?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will learn rules to a safe password as well as make their own.
Dos and Don’ts of a Password  (30 Minutes)
As a class, have students guess if a rule to making a password is a “do” or a “don’t”. 
DO make passwords eight or more characters long. (Longer passwords are harder to crack than shorter ones.)
DON’T use dictionary words as your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DO include letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. (It can be harder to guess passwords with this combination.)
DO change your password at least every six months. (This way, even if someone does guess your password, they won’t be able to get into your account for long.)
DON’T use private identity information in your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DON’T use your phone number as your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DON’T use your nickname as your password. (It could be easy for others to guess.)
DO give your password to your parent or guardian. (They will help you remember it if you forget it.)
DON’T share your password with your friends. (Even if you trust them, they might unintentionally do something that puts you or your information at risk.)
DO create a password that you can remember. (It’s okay to create a random password, but keep in mind that it should be one that you can remember, or else it won’t do you much good.)
Ask: Which tips did you know? Which ones surprised you?
Have students get into groups and discuss these two scenarios for DOs and DON’Ts:
Amy forgets their phone on the bus. IF someone found it and figured out their password to unlock it, THEN what could happen? 
Henry writes their email address in their notebook and leaves it open while they go to the bathroom. IF someone saw Henry’s email address and figured out their email password, THEN what could happen? 


Have students play the Password Protect game in Digital Passport™ by Common Sense Education. This will help introduce key concepts of this lesson. https://www.digitalpassport.org/password-protect.html 
Have students create their own password! Give each student four black cards / pieces of paper. For these papers, have students write down their favorite number, cartoon character’s name, food, and a random symbol. 
Let students play the “test your password” game which can be found at https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2
Assessment (15 Minutes)
Give out the Powerful Passwords Assessment found here: https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2 
Finish by asking students some ways they can avoid password theft and what they can do in the event that it happens.

## REVIEW
(KNOWLEDGE) ASSESSMENT
Objective #1 - What is a Password?
Have the students go into groups and designate one student to write down their concluded answer. Ask groups what a password is.
Objective #2 - Why are Passwords Important on the Internet?
Remaining in their groups, have students give three reasons as to why passwords are important in the context of the Internet.
Objective #3 - What are Some Dos and Don'ts to a Password?
This objective is assessed from the last part of the activity.
POST-TEST
What is a password?
What are some consequences of someone finding out your password?
What should you do if someone discovers your password?
