# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Middle School Students love to share everything-including their water bottles, their sense of humor and even their passwords.  This lesson demonstrates why passwords shouldnt be shared and furthermore the importance of a strong password.  It also teaches how to create a strong password!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1.  I can give three reasons why I shouldnt share my password.
2.  I have three strategies to make a strong password.
3.  Being a smart digital citizen means passwords are important because:
## OBJECTIVES
1-Understand the importance of NOT sharing passwords.
2-Create a strong password.
3-Make an informed decision when asked to share a password.


## CATCH/HOOK
Have students lock their computers.  Tell students to trade computers with the person sitting next to them.  Tell students to guess the person's password.  (Note-my district uses the same formula for all preset passwords).  Engage in a discussion of this experience.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Return laptops to original owner.
IMPORTANCE OF PASSWORD
Ask-how did that feel knowing someone was trying to unlock your laptop?  
Ask-how would someone else be able to unlock your laptop?
Ask-for personal stories if comfortable.
HOW TO CREATE A STRONG PASSWORD
Introduce Common Sense Media.  Have students rely on their background information to remember what a .org means.  Have students spend a few minutes browsing Common Sense Media website looking for authors, dates, biases.  
Participate in the Do's and Dont's of a password: 
https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2
Go through the entire activity.
RESPONSIBLE DIGITAL CITIZEN
Engage in a small debate: which is more important-
Not hacking someone's password OR creating a strong password.
This debate will show both are equally important!

## REVIEW
IF there is time,  divide into four teams.  Have each time create a password, then use:

to see which team has the strongest password-hopefully ALL teams will have strong passwords!
