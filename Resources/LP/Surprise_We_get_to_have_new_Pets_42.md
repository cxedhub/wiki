## Lesson Plan
### Overview
This is an opportunity for students to learn more about coding through creating a micro:pet with a partner,  It will involve following directions.  It will involve design and problem solving.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Which of the following is a new use for a micro:bit,
Identify ways I can make changes and test a micro:bit.


### OBJECTIVES
Identify a new use for a micro:bit,
Generate potential ideas and add to othersâ€™ ideas
Make changes and test again, repeating until satisfied with the product


### CATCH/HOOK
This is an opportunity for students to learn more about coding through creating a micro:pet with a partner


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will use the activity at  https://makecode.microbit.org/courses/csintro/making/project as a close to our sessions, this will be a collaborative project and will be displayed during science night.
