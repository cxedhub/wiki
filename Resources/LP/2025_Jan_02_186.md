# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The students will work together to create an algorithm to solve the problem of how we transition. Steps will be created and agreed upon by the class as to how we will transition from one activity to another.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What steps need to be taken to transition from one activity to another?
## OBJECTIVES
Be able to plan, complete a task with peers, shift attention between tasks and move through transitions with minimal direction.
Create and follow algorithms for daily activities.


## CATCH/HOOK
Ask students how they get dressed in the morning. Make silly mistakes such as saying that I put on my pants before my underwear.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
As the students sit in whole group, ask them to say the steps they take to get dressed in the morning. Write down the steps the students say. Make some silly mistakes such as say that you put your pants on before your underwear. Discuss that in class, we have steps we must take to move from one activity to another. Introduce the word 'algorithm'. Ask the students to help list the steps that we need to take in order to transition to the bathroom. Discuss that we will create an 'algorithm' or steps needed to make the transition smooth. Using the smart board, the teacher will assist the students with creating a 'map' to the restroom. Once completed, the teacher will utilize the map to transition the class to the restroom.

## REVIEW
Once back in the classroom, the teacher will review the steps with the students.
