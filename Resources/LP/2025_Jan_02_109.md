# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson, students are introduced to computer science through the use of Micro|bits to create a model of the lunar phases as seen on Earth. In order to complete this lesson, students must already have an understanding of the phases of the moon. Students do not need previous experience working with Micro|bits for the lesson.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is computer science?
 Using a computer, problem solving, a type of science, or computer coding only. 


2.What is an algorithm?
Something in math, a phase of the moon, the answer to a question, or a set of steps


3. What lights up the moon?
The moon itself, Earth's reflection, the sun's reflected light, or the man on the moon
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to use a Micro:bit to model a lunar phase
Students will be able to model lunar phases 
Students will be able to identify strengths and weaknesses of their models


## CATCH/HOOK
The catch for this lesson is a picture of a Micro:bit projected stating 'mini computer' as well as the teacher holding Micro:bits in her hand when students enter the classroom.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson will take 1.5 class periods. 0.5 class periods for learning how to use the Micro:bit and makecode website. 1 class period for the creation of the lunar phase model using the Micro:bit. 


Computer Science Introduction
Teacher introduces computer science as a field of science dedicated to problem solving; especially solving large problems using steps called algorithms. 


Introduction to Micro:bit and Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit (microbit.org)
Teacher introduces students to the Micro:bit. The Micro:bit is a mini computer capable of following instructions students give it on the website makecode.microbit.org


Teacher introduces students to the makecode website. Students are shown how to create a new project and input basic blocks. This will be student’s introduction to computer programming. Have students explore creating different shapes with the “show led” block, creating strings of words, and showing icons. These will be the main blocks needed to model the phases of the moon. Introduce students to other blocks such as input blocks like “on button A pressed”. Give students time to be creative as they explore the capabilities of this website and their little Micro:bit. 


Before the end of this piece of the lesson, have students:
•        Spell out their name on the Micro:bit
•        Insert an icon
•        Create a shape using the “show led” block


Introduce the Problem
Teacher introduces the problem to solve: We need to model lunar phases as we see them on Earth! Given this information, students work in pairs to recall:
•        How many lunar phases are there?
•        Do some phases last longer than other phases? If so, which ones?


Students discuss with class their answers to the above questions. Given their responses, the problem is revised to be: We need to model lunar phases as we see them on Earth- with some phases slowly building on a continuum.


To increase student engagement, teacher refers to the problem as the challenge for today. Students’ challenge is to: tell the computer what steps to do by programming the computer to create a lunar phase model that:
        Shows the moon from Earth
        Starts with a New Moon
        Includes all the lunar phases in order
        Gradually progresses through the phases
        Repeats the whole cycle


Tackling the Problem
Students brainstorm with partners what steps (algorithms) would be needed to show a lunar phase. Most students will choose to use the “show led” block to model a phase. Then have students brainstorm how they could show a phase transitioning into another phase. This is important, since students often draw the lunar phases without having to think about the transition points. 


Students will continue working in pairs for this project so that they have practice sharing and hearing diverse ideas. Give students time to explore and experiment as they model lunar phases. A common error to watch for includes if students’ models are waxing and waning on the correct sides. Additionally, students may need to explain their thinking since each model is unique.


Creating Sun- Earth – Moon Model
Once students have created a model of the lunar phases, have students download their program onto their Micro:bit so the Micro:bit can act independent of the computer. Have students then draw and cut out both a Sun and an Earth. Using the cut outs and the Micro:bit, students can create a sun- earth- moon model showing all three bodies interacting.

## REVIEW
After students have completed their model, have students reflect on the strengths of this Micro:bit model in modeling lunar phases. Compare this model to other models done previously. Similarly, have students discuss some weaknesses of this model. Have them also compare this model’s weaknesses to weaknesses of other previously constructed models.
