# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will collect data on what animals they would keep in a library. Students will choose their top 5 animals that they would have in their zoo. They will then take surveys of students in the classroom to see which animals are the most popular, or how many people chose the same animals as them.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What animal do you predict will be the most popular?
What animal was the most popular? 
What is a better way that you can think of to find this information?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to collect data on student opinions of 5 different animals.
Students will show the information in a chart (bar graph).
Students will be able to show the information in a data table.


## CATCH/HOOK
Set out several research books on different animals that may be used later in the unit. Have the students start looking at them and deciding what kind of animals they would want.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Start by doing a book walk through the books that have been gathered that can be used for our research. After they've gotten an idea of what they would put in their zoo, they will make their graphs with their 5 animals. They will then go from student to student and record their answers. Afterwards they will make the graphs in Google Spreadsheets using color blocking.

## REVIEW
Review with the students the answers to their pre/post questions. Discuss why those animals would be most popular, then have them narrow down to their top three that they would like to research for the next lesson.
