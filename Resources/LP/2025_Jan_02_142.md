title: Create a cookie cutter device using technology and 3D printing to understand adding and subtracting fractions.
description: In this lesson students will create a  cookie cutter to help them practice adding and subtracting fractions. They will start by using play-doh to create a model of what they would like their cutter to look like. Then they will use a computer program to create the model. Once the model is finished, students will be able to print the cookie cutter (artifact) using a 3D printer.  Once they have this tool students can use it model adding and subtracting fractions and provide them hands on practice to check their work.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson students will create a  cookie cutter to help them practice adding and subtracting fractions. They will start by using play-doh to create a model of what they would like their cutter to look like. Then they will use a computer program to create the model. Once the model is finished, students will be able to print the cookie cutter (artifact) using a 3D printer.  Once they have this tool students can use it model adding and subtracting fractions and provide them hands on practice to check their work.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a 3D model?


How do you create a 3D model using a computer?


Provide a model and equation showing addition and subtraction of a fraction with a common denominator.
## OBJECTIVES
Teach students how to create a 3D model


Create a 3D cookie cutter model 


Print cookie cutter model and show understanding of adding and subtracting fractions.


## CATCH/HOOK
Engage your students in math using fun technology skills to allow them to master adding and subtracting fractions.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Introduce Content- students are beginning to work with fractions and should be introduced to the content of adding and subtracting fractions using pictures, pencil, and paper. 
2. Next, students will use play-doh to create a model of the cookie cutter they are going to create. 
3. Students will use TinkerCad to create their model using their laptop. 
4. Finally, after student has finished print their cookie cutters. 
5. After students have their cookie cutter students can use the cutter and play-doh to model adding and subtracting fractions.

## REVIEW
Students can use the cookie cutters for a quick warm up, other fraction lessons, and have also gained computer science skills.
