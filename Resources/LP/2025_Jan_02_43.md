   + This activity would be best with codable manipulatives like Ozbots or Beebots.  The author of this lesson plan has no experience with them, but hopes to gain some soon.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson uses the familiar nursery rhyme and song 'There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly' to introduce primary students to the concepts of sequencing and looping in algorithms. It can also be used with older students as an example that leads them to writing their own unique code that includes loops.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What words repeat and stack in the song?  What words rhyme in the song?
## OBJECTIVES
1.  Repeat the rhyme/song back in the correct order.
2.  Define loop, sequence, chain tale.
3.  Construct their own unique and logical loop, complete with rhyming words, if age appropriate.


## CATCH/HOOK
Borrowed from Dr. Jean Feldman, I have constructed an 'Old Lady' apron, which has a clear ziploc bag sewn into the tummy area so that the kids can see what the old lady (me!) is swallowing when I wear it.  I have done this with all ages of kids, and they all seem fascinated.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
After singing the song with the apron on, students will examine how the song is an example of a chain tale and a sequence and loop in coding.

## REVIEW
This lesson could be as simple or complex as the age of the students and the knowledge of the teacher warrant.
