# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will explore how sensors are used in our lives and what they could measure. Students will build a Lego car and use the a microbit to measure acceleration.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Where do we find sensors in our lives and how are they used? What are some benefits?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to code a microbit to use the accelerometer sensor.
Students will use collected data (acceleration, performance,  etc.) to improve their prototype.


## CATCH/HOOK
Build a the fastest Lego car and code a micro:bit to measure its acceleration to. prove you have the fastest car.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will create a Lego car prototype and code and use the microbit to measure acceleration using the accelerometer sensor. Students will collect and use data to improve their model.

## REVIEW
It is a fun lesson with many teaching angles, but the coding is advance so there will need to be some background work and testing.
