# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Decomposing a design problem with Elements of Art
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Definitions of the 7 Elements of Art; Line, Shape, Color, Value, Texture, Space, Form. 
Definitions of decomposing and subproblems in CS.
Did the student answer the questions who, what, when, where, how?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will list out what they know about the famous work of art they've been given to study. For example: Wassily Kandinsky's 'Kleine Welten I', 1922. Who is the audience? What is the purpose? When in history was it created? Where is it displayed now? Why did the artist create it?


Students will identify the exact Elements of Art they see in the making of this work of art, collecting data for all 7 with tally marks of each found. EOA: Line, Shape, Color, Texture, Space, Value, Form


Students will take more data based on specific qualities of each element of art. For example: 5 lines parallel to one another


Students will swap data with another student to create their own Abstract drawing by using their peers data collected.


## CATCH/HOOK
An original work of art can be created by using data from found by another person. You see lines, but another students sees shapes. Communication in programming needs to be specific. Design in Art also communicates, even though our perspective could be different than the artist's intended message.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Each students studies and lists the Elements of Art found in the famous work of art, then answers the questions 'who, what, when, where, how' (like problem solving in CS decomposition of a problem). Subproblem is tally marking each of the 7 elements of art, noting angle of lines, sizes of shapes, brightness of color, etc. Once data is collected, students swap with another peer and try to read their data to interpret solving the problem to create an original work of art.

## REVIEW
Small group discussion after the first day about how subjective identifying elements of art could be in a work of art. How creating more specific 'subproblems' (angles, color schemes, size, etc) could help their peer to understand better how to interpret their data.
After the new work of art is created, then students will compare the famous artwork to their own interpretation. This relates to how important it is to be clear communicating details in programming.
