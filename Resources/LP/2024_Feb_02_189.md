# Lesson Plan
## Overview
On the internet, students interact with websites, peers, and strangers throughout the day. With that said, students must be very careful about what they share and what information they give out. Information travels fast along the internet. Be mindful of what you say or post.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What kind of dangers are on the internet?
2. How can we minimize the risk of our information or other's stolen?
3. Why is it important to keep our information safe?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students understand that there are dangers on the internet. 
2. Students can identify how to minimize the risks of information being stolen on the internet.
3. Students discuss why it is important to keep their information safe.


## CATCH/HOOK
You just gave your cellphone number to a new friend in a chat room. He or she seems super nice and you would love to hang out again. Later that night, you begin to receive prank calls. What happened? Unfortunately, since the chat room was public, your new 'friend' posted your number on the internet. You are devastated and wonder how this could have happened.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Explain to the students that we will be learning about how and why it is important to be careful what we send over the internet. 


2. Head to https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/internetsafetyforkids/staying-safe-from-online-predators/1/


3. Follow through lesson one with the students. Remember to have pair and share opportunities during your discussion. 


4. When finished, have the students open https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/mindful-mountain and head to the Mindful Mountain. This is a fun game to wrap up that give pointers on what kind of information you should or should not share on the internet. 


5. If time permits, or you would like to on another day, go through all the lessons for internet safety for kids. 


6. End with a short paragraph quick write answering these three questions: What kind of dangers are on the internet? How can we minimize the risk of our information or other's stolen? Why is it important to keep our information safe?
