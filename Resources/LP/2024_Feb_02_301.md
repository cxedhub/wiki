# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is an introduction to computational thinking and the BBC micro:bit. Students learn how to create nature abstractions by observing nature, using art materials and then using the LEDs on micro:bit.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1-I can abstract relevant detail from a nature image and code an LED representation of it!
## OBJECTIVES
-can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation


-can analyze problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems


-can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies, analytically to solve problems


-are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will do a nature walk, either outside weather permitting, or inside the library.  In the library, there is a garden and at least 15 different plants.  They are going to notice the living things, notice what they like, what they dont like, which smells they like, which ones they dont.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson/activity is multi-faceted.  Broken into 4 chunks: Representing nature, Art algorithms, Digital nature representations, Programming & evaluating representations.  Each section has a specific slide in the Google Doc to explain it!

## REVIEW
Students can evaluate their LED nature art and discuss their responses in their pairs/groups. Then they have sufficient time to independently complete the evaluation sheet. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wum34k-q4tQPmBG8xwh7hbezT8Dbmj4oOrDhXIeAscA/edit
