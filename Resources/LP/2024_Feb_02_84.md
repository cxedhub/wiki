# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Geodynamics powers the Earth’s magnetic field, which is magnetic north.  There is also a true north which is the Earth’s geographic north. Can students accurately determine Earth’s magnetic north using a micro-processor to have a successful geocaching experience? Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores the natural world using microprocessors.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Explain and make a diagram of how the Earth creates magnetic fields.


What materials (stuff/things) do you think need to be present in a Microbit so that it can work as a compass?


If you were in southern hemisphere, would that change how a Microbit function.  Justify your reasoning.  


How difficult or easier would this assignment have been, if you were assigned to Geocache without a programmed compass Microbit?  Explain what would have been harder and easier for Geocaching. 


Make a diagram that compares and contrast Earth’s magnetic poles versus geographic poles. 


The magnetic poles of the Earth move continuously and very slowly over time.   How do you think the Earth would be affected if the poles switched places?  In other words, the magnetic north became the magnetic south and vis-versa.
## OBJECTIVES
Students will study the phenomenon of the Earth magnetic field.  
Students will be able to explain the difference between true and magnetic north and everyday objects that use magnetic north.  
Students will create a program that runs a compass on a Microbit.


## CATCH/HOOK
Are you the best geocacher?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pre-Test Questions (5-10 minutes):  
Use colored pencils to make a diagram of the Earth.  Label true north and south.  
Next, label magnetic north and south on your Earth diagram. 
Name 1-object that uses Earth’s magnetic field.  Explain how you think this object works using the Earth magnetic field. 
Name 1-object that uses geographic north and south. Explain how you think this object works using the Earth geographic north and south. 
Identify any misconceptions in pre-test questions or conversations with students. 


Pre-Assessment (10 minutes):  All students will be given a pre-assessment (examples of assessment questions are listed at the bottom of this lesson).  They will be required to submit a lab journal during this investigation.  
Identify any misconceptions in pre-assessment questions.


Introduction (15 minutes):  Review, if needed Earth magnetic fields (Arbor scientific video), how the hot interior causes Earth’s magnetic fields and what are geographic north and south poles.  Have students read how the compass sensor works. Have students work in groups and brain storm how to program the Microbit so that it can work as a compass.  


Use an entrance ticket to check for understanding and misconceptions of the introduction. 


Microbit (10 minutes) Students make a Microbit that functions as a compass using magnetic north. Remind students to write in their lab book their trials, any errors and successes.     
Monitor students’ progress and ask questions.
