# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will build an anemometer to measure the wind and predict weather patterns in Wyoming.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How does an anemometer find the wind speed?
Explain how the data you collected showed how wind speed, temperature and clouds can help predict the weather.
## OBJECTIVES
Use engineering skills to build an anemometer and test it in the real world.
Collect data and interpret it to predict weather patterns. 
Share and graph their data and present it to their peers.


## CATCH/HOOK
Any guesses on a “W” word that we hear almost everyday in Wyoming? Share with your partner and make a list, be ready to share!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Everything is written out on the Google Slide presentation linked below.

## REVIEW
Students will share their Google Slide presentations with the class to show what they have learned about the wind speeds and predicting weather.
