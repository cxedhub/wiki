## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will understand the importance of cybersecurity in agricultural technologies. Students will explore the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with agricultural technologies. Students will learn strategies and best practices for ensuring cybersecurity in agricultural settings based on research from provided article resources and classroom discussion.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Class participation during discussions and activities.
Quality of group discussions and presentations on cybersecurity risks and strategies.


### OBJECTIVES
Students will understand the importance of cybersecurity in agricultural technologies. 
Students will explore the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with agricultural technologies. 
Students will learn strategies and best practices for ensuring cybersecurity in agricultural settings.


### CATCH/HOOK
Begin the lesson by asking students to brainstorm and discuss the ways technology is used in modern agriculture.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
10 minutes - Introduce the concept of cybersecurity and explain its importance in agricultural technologies.
Give an overview of the different aspects of cybersecurity using the hand method 
Index Finger - Confidentiality (shh!!)
Ring Finger - Integrity
Thumb - Availability (Thumbs up / Good to go!)
Middle - Think Like an Adversary
Pinky - Keep it Simple
Palm - Defense in Depth
Facilitate a class discussion on why cybersecurity is crucial in the agricultural sector. 
Prompt questions: What are the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with agricultural technologies? Why is it important to protect agricultural systems from cyber threats?
Use the projector or interactive whiteboard to display examples of cyber attacks or incidents that have occurred in the agricultural industry.
20 minutes - Direct students to online articles (or print out for hard copies) discussing real-world examples of cybersecurity issues in agriculture.
In four small groups, one for each of the articles, have students analyze and discuss the potential impacts of cyber attacks on agricultural technologies and the broader implications for food security and the economy.






### REVIEW
10 Minutes - Have each of the groups present information they discussed about each of the articles, focusing on impacts and implications for food security and the economy.
