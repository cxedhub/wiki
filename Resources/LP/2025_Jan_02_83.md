# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson students are reminded about the ever growing uses of technology devices within the healthcare profession, and how technology addresses many of the largest health issues we face. Students will brainstorm and program a device to address a real-world healthcare problem, of their choice.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
In what ways is Computer Sciences used in the healthcare system?
What are some devices used within the healthcare system that we can program using a micro:bit?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will understand the use to technology in the world healthcare system
Students will develop and understand the importance of prototyping
Students will use the algorithm to write, test and debug a working Micro:bit program


## CATCH/HOOK
Computer Sciences in Healthcare is inevitable, daily, our healthcare is changing as we once knew it. In this activity I want to challenge you to learn how to program current pieces of technology our healthcare providers already use! (Video: https://youtu.be/G1IsZeFR_Rk)


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Explain to the students that their challenge is going to be to create a prototype of a device that is used within the healthcare system, using mirco:bit.
As a class, complete this Step counter activity provided by mirco:bit, to provide the students with an example of a device that would be acceptable in this challenge.
Advise students that their first challenge is to decompose this larger problem into smaller steps they will need to take to solve the challenge.
Assemble students into small teams that will be working together for this challenge, give out paper and pens.
Give teams a 5 minute time amount to decide what area of health they wish to focus on and ask them to brainstorm and write down what they think they will need to complete the challenge.
Depending on their level of experience with micro:bit, you may need to set expectations around what they could prototype while encouraging creativity and reminding them they only have to present a representation (an abstraction) of their innovation. 
Ensure students have access to all that they need to complete their prototype and give them ample time to complete it, offering support and interim ‘time and progress checks’ as appropriate.
You may wish to run a series of ‘workshops/ micro:bit tangents’ with representatives from each group responsible for that task.

## REVIEW
Invite students to think/pair/share in their teams what they have achieved and learned in this challenge.
