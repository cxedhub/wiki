# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is an unplugged activity where students will work in mixed grade level teams (Kindergarten and 5th grade) to guide a blindfolded partner through an obstacle course in as little time as possible.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How would you tell a friend how to get to the school cafeteria if they have never been there?


 - It is assumed that prior to the activity, the students will give a basic answer with few descriptive details and that after the lesson the the students will answer more thoroughly in preparation for understanding coding.
## OBJECTIVES
1. I can work as a team (not including the blindfolded partner) to give accurate, step by step directions for the blindfolded person to safely make it through the obstacle course in minimal time. 
2. I can collaborate with my team, changes that can be made when completing the obstacle course the second time, in order to be efficient.


## CATCH/HOOK
After the pre test question, teachers will stand back to back while one demonstrates how to make a paper airplane and gives directions to the other teacher. Both teachers will build, but the teacher who gives directions will be doing this correctly, while the teacher learning will not have adequate directions to complete the task correctly. This will allow the students to understand the importance of using explicit step by step directions when completing the lesson.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Give pre-assessment question
2. Teachers will demonstrate how to make a paper airplane (hook) (see above)
3. Teachers will group students into mixed grade teams of 3-4 students. 
4. Students will be assigned jobs (Competitor, Director (tells blindfolded where to go), Timer, Facilitator (leads discussions - this can be combined with the timer for groups of three).
5. Facilitator will blindfold the Competitor and leave them on the start line
6. The remaining group members will go to the collaboration station (a taped square near the start line where teammates have to discuss and agree on the directions that the Director will give to the Competitor.
7. The Competitor will then specifically follow the directions that the Director gives to complete the obstacle course. 
*For each direction given, the team members will need to meet and agree on the next direction in the collaboration station prior to the Competitor moving forward through the obstacle course.
8. The Timer will have a stop watch and will be timing the total length it takes for the Competitor to complete the obstacle course and tally how many total directions given. 
9. Teams will record their time and number of directions on chart paper (taped to the wall) for each attempt at the obstacle course. 
10. After completing the obstacle course the first time, teams will have an opportunity to discuss possible changes and to change rolls, as well as complete the obstacle course again as time permits. Repeat directions 5 to 9.
