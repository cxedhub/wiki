## Lesson Plan
### Overview
How are devices that are not physically connected able to communicate? Micro bits will be used to help students understand and demonstrate how devices communicate with each other.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Why do we need to protect ourselves digitally?


### OBJECTIVES
Model the role of protocols in transmitting data across networks and the internet


### CATCH/HOOK
I have a Shield I can use as a physical representation for the protection that we need when on the internet


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be taught how to communicate with multiple micro bits.






### REVIEW
How do you protect your personal information?


### STANDARDS
