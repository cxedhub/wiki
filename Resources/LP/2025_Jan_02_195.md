# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Searching for websites can be time-consuming. Imagine having to re-discover the places where we buy our groceries or where we like to play. For the same reason we memorize the routes to our favorite locations, our devices memorize our favorite websites. This is called bookmarking.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can students identify the various icons that bookmark websites?
Do students know how to name the bookmarks?
When necessary, can students manage bookmarks by editing, updating, deleting and cataloguing them?
## OBJECTIVES
Store the bookmark for a website
Manage bookmarks


## CATCH/HOOK
We all have websites we go to regularly. These are popular, we talk about them with our friends and even share our activities. But, when we come across websites that are every bit as important but do not go there often, we need a way for our device to memorize that location. That is where bookmarks come in.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I) Storing Bookmarks (Class)
Icons (5mins) Show the different types of icons used by different websites.
Star
Page w/ bookmark hangin down
Two-tailed rectangle
Bookmark Names (10mins) Walk-through the process of bookmarking a website touching on 3 key elements:
Default name given
Personalized/Edited name
Strategies for naming
Using parts of the website name as a clue and abbreviation to save space
Managing Bookmarks
Change name
Exercise(10mins): Go to SDSC#3 website and bookmark the calendar
Then change the name to something easy to recognize
Update address
Exercise(5mins): Change address of bookmark showing how it now goes somewhere else; then change it back.
Organize Bookmarks
Exercise(15mins): Bookmark up to 5 websites. Then, sort them into groups based on why they are important. Now, create a folder for each group and give it a name. Finally, move each bookmark to its appropriate location.

## REVIEW
This may seem super easy and unnecessary. However, as the years go by and we use multiple devices to go to many different sites, it becomes likely we will lose or forget certain sites. Bookmarking these sites and organizing them into easy to search folders will make it so we can quickly and easily move from one site to another. Now you all know how to manage your bookmarks so you can update them as you grow.
