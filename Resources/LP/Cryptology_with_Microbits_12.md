## Lesson Plan
### Overview
This activity will introduce the Caesar Cipher to students on makecode.microbit.org.  Students will explore the Caesar Cipher using words.  Students will than elaborate to make connections between the Caesar Cipher and translations in functions.


### PRE/POST-TEST
What is a shift cipher?
What happens to a function when it is translated?
How are translations and the Caesar Cipher related?


### OBJECTIVES
Student will be able to explain how the Caesar Cipher and translations in functions relate to each other.


### CATCH/HOOK
Students will be given a code to decipher that is encrypted using a shift cipher.  This lesson will follow the Cryptology lesson.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The Caesar Cipher hex file will be shared with students to import into their makecode account.  After the cipher is explained, students will have time to explore it themselves.  After 5-10 minutes students will be asked to share any revelations.  After discussion, I will share another file that contains an algebraic function.  Students will have time to explore individually and then share out as a group.






### REVIEW
We will wrap up by comparing translations of functions to the Caesar cipher.


### STANDARDS        
MA.912.F.2.1 Identify the effect on the graph or table of a given function after replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, for specific values of k.
