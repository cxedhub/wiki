# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson, students are introduced to the concept of “climate” and explore the world’s five major climates. In the activity, Climate Decoder, students color one part of a world map to figure out the different climates of that region. Students then combine maps and search for global climate patterns.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
If you met someone from another country, what questions would you ask to figure out
what climate he or she is from?
## OBJECTIVES
Label Maps with types of climates based on regions.


## CATCH/HOOK
Talk about the temperature changes students have felt in the last few weeks of school.  Draw a picture of what the day looks and feels like.  Compare what they remember what the first week of school was like.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Each student will create a section of a map and then work together to put a map together. They will compare the climate of their recordings and placing them on the map.

## REVIEW
This lesson can be broken up to use for 20-30 minute time frame over 5 days or in one setting.  It can can be adapted to your schedule.


Day 1: Watch Exploration Video
Day 2: Activity Set Up and Activity
Day 3-4: Continue Activity
Day 5: Wrap Up
Follow all instruction with Mystery Science Video
