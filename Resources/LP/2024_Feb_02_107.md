# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The instructor will ask the students to decode a message from binary. The instructor will then explain to students the connection between binary and computer memory and strings of bits. After this, the instructor will take the students through the process of creating an individual drawing that will be pieced together to make a large poster image. This relates to a binary code, in that each small piece is like a code and together strings to make a final piece or image.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a program?
What are binary codes?
## OBJECTIVES
Objective #1: Teach students what a binary is and how that correlates to computer memory. 
Objective #2: Students will learn the process of enlarging an image and the practice of enlarging the process by participating in a group drawing.


## CATCH/HOOK
Between storing data and opening people up to the world through social media, computers have become a vital part of our daily lives.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pixel Coding 3 Way 
Separate the kids into 3 groups.
Give each group one part of the encoded message.
Give the kids around 10 minutes to solve the code.
Repeat with each different types of Code (Program your Painter, Write your own Binary Code and ASCII Code Alphabet)
Have each group share out what they did to solve the code. 
Consider: What worked best? Did one group solve the problem in a way you didn’t think about? What would you do differently? 
Reference the Rise model.
Explain to the students that they just acted like a computer at the most basic level, translating bits to actions and tasks and vice versa to be displayed on a computer screen.
Drawing with the Grid
IMPLEMENTATION: For a 50 minute class, times may vary.
DAY 1: Introduction
Ask students why they used the grid to redraw their images: 
 Guide the conversation to helping to accurately draw an image and it helps break the image down into lines and shapes to simplify the image.
 Explain that the grid method can also be used to accurately enlarge an image.
Tell the students each one of them will be drawing a small section of a larger image.
Once all the drawings are complete they will be put together and the final image will be revealed. They will not know what they are drawing until the very end. Although it might seem like they are drawing abstract shapes and lines, each piece is an incredibly important part of making the large image come together.
Explain the process of laying out the grid onto your paper
Each student will start with one 1”x1” square and one 4”x4” blank square (this may vary based on the image size you choose)
On the back of the 1”x1” square will be a letter and a number.
 It is VERY IMPORTANT to write the letter and number on the back of the blank square.  Make sure when you
DAY 2-3: Collaborative Grid
Have students get out their squares and keep working.
Once they are finished, collect them. Double check the letter and number are on the back and it is pointing the same direction as it is on the small square.
Give them a second, third, or however many you planned for them to complete.
Check off the completed squares as the finish.
Once they are finished with all the squares they can work in their visual journals until they are all complete.
Allow students to clean up the last few minutes of class.
DAY 4-5: Wrap and Reveal
Once all squares are turned in, start piecing together the final image. (This can be done as they are turned in). Use masking tape to tape the backside of the squares together.
Once it is all pieced together, reveal it to the class and have them guess what it is. The lines will not line up perfectly and it will look like an abstracted version of the original, but that is what makes it interesting.

## REVIEW
Once it is all pieced together, reveal it to the class and have them guess what it is. The lines will not line up perfectly and it will look like an abstracted version of
the original, but that is what makes it interesting.
