# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students use flowcharts and repetition to explore building a volcanic eruption on a Micro:Bit.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the impact of a volcanic eruption?
## OBJECTIVES
I can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems.
I can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies, analytically to solve problems.
We are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology.


## CATCH/HOOK
Video of volcano eruption, story map of Yellowstone's Caldera, and scientist exploring the empty volcano cavity in Iceland.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This series of five lessons takes students through a mixture of fun unplugged and programming activities related to animations, pupils develop their understanding of decomposition, flowchart algorithms and repetition. They then write, program and test an animation showing volcanic eruption using the LEDs on the BBC micro:bit.

## REVIEW
In this 'unplugged' lesson students are introduced to the theme of animation and produce a thinking map based on the subject. They then develop their understanding decomposition by planning a dance sequence and creating a flipbook animation.
Then they follow their algorithm to write a program using the BBC micro:bit MakeCode editor and explore how repetition can be used to create an animation.
In this ‘unplugged’ lesson students plan a volcanic eruption animation using the BBC micro:bit. They decompose the process into stages and write a simple flowchart algorithm. 
Students follow their algorithm and write a program to create their volcanic eruption animation using the MakeCode editor.
ln this ‘unplugged’ lesson, students reflect on their learning by decomposing the steps they took to create their animation and record this using a thinking map.
