# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson introduces the beginning concepts of coding. Students will learn with a programmable caterpillar or code-a-pillar that will be coded to reach an end point.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre test questions
1. Can you make the code-a-pillar move?
2. Can you change the sequence of the code-a-pillar?
3. Can you code the code-a-pillar to reach an end point?
Post test questions
1. Did you make the code-a-pillar move?
2. Did you change the sequence of the code-a-pillar?
3. Did you code the code-a-pillar to reach an end point?
4. Did the code-a-pillar make it to the end point?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Work in small groups to program or code a caterpillar.
2. Work in small groups to get the caterpillar to start and finish to a designated spot.
3. Learn about the importance of algorithms or step-by-step procedures.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will show the students a Youtube video of the code-a-pillar and how it works.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. I will introduce the code-a-pillar by playing a short Youtube video. 
2. After the video, I will show the students how to take the code-a-pillar apart, change the sequence, and put it back together.
3. I will talk about the start point and end point that we want the code-a-pillar to follow.
4. I will also explain what an algorithm is and how we will code the code-a-pillar by using a step by step process to complete his task by getting to the end point.
