## Lesson Plan
### Overview
This is an introduction to the CyberSecurity aspect of National Intelligence


### PRE/POST-TEST
What is the CIA Triade and the 5 parts of the hand of CyberSecurity


### OBJECTIVES
Demonstrate understanding of key concepts
Students will be able to create a physical example to share with club members and community


### CATCH/HOOK
So, you want to work for the DNI?


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The students will be introduced into the basics of CyberSecurity and how it fits within the DNI (national intelligence) framework. They will then do a research paper and create a project using the micro:bit to demonstrate a skill or concept they learned






### REVIEW
Students will be able to build onto what was learned and create a higher level lesson which could be shared at the community event


### STANDARDS        
No standard, as this is tied to club work, but it is an extension of AP Historical style questioning skills (Causation, Comparison, Similarities/Differences, Cause/Effect)
