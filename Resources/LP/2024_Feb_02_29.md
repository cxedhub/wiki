# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this activity, students develop a 'weather station' where they collect at least three types of weather data.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What weather factors can a Micro:Bit measure?
How can I use the engineering process to build a Micro:Bit weather station?
## OBJECTIVES
use the engineering process to develop a functional weather station that collects data using a Micro:Bit.
use previous knowledge of block coding to code a functional data collection Micro:Bit.


## CATCH/HOOK
Use analog tools to collect weather data. (Thermometer, hygrometer, anemometer, wind vane, etc.) Discuss how digital devices might make collecting data more accurate and simpler.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will use resources to develop a Micro:Bit weather station that records at least 3 weather factors.

## REVIEW
Teacher can present the digital notebook for students to plan and produce a weather station. The teacher should provide students with an available materials list.
