# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this project, you and a partner will code a program that is capable of sending a coded message to each other. Each of you will have a microbit and will need to code the ‘a’ and ‘b’ buttons to send two different messages, that when combined with a key can be decrypted. You can use binary, morse code, or create a coded message system of your own!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do you ensure that two microbits are communicating on the same radio group?
Compare and contrast the “on start”, “forever” and “on button ‘a’ pressed” blocks.
Why is it important to send messages that are coded/encrypted?
## OBJECTIVES
Code a microbit to send a radio signal to another microbit
Code a microbit to send different messages when different buttons are pressed


## CATCH/HOOK
Show a brief video or have a quick discussion on the uses and applications of coded messaging throughout history.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Use makecode.microbit.org to create a coded messaging program that can send coded messages to other microbits.


BEFORE YOU BEGIN CODING:
Find the following blocks of code, right click on them, and select the “help” option. Then read the documentation for that block so that you understand how it works! You will have to search through the block options on the left side of the screen to find each of these.
“Radio set group” block
“Radio send number” block
“On radio received…” block
“On button ‘a’ pressed” block
“If…then” block


Your program should do the following:
Send a coded message to another microbit. A coded message is a message that cannot be read without the knowledge of how to translate it into letters or words.


Your message can be coded in any way you want! Some examples include binary and morse code. You can also create your own coded language to use, but be careful as this can take up a lot of your time! Start simple, you can always make it more complicated later.

## REVIEW
Have random pairs of students demonstrate their communication device and describe their coded language system to the class.
