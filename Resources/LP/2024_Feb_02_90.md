# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will create a 'guitar' from cardboard, aluminum foil, and a micro:bit and explain how energy is converted from touch to electricity to sound.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How does a computer know to make sounds?
What types of energy can be changed from one type to another?
How do you improve a code?
## OBJECTIVES
code and design a microbit guitar.
explain how energy transfer occurs in order for the guitar to work.


## CATCH/HOOK
Demonstrate an example guitar. If possible, hide the alligator clips and microbit. Ask students how the computer knows to play notes. Have them generate questions to explore.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This activity is based on: https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/scratch-guitar/
Have students cut out a cardboard instrument and affix three strips of foil to one end of the instrument and another to the other.   Attach the GND pin to the lone strip using alligator clips. Then use alligator clips to the three other strips to pins 0, 1, 2. Connect the MicroBit to the computer and code the code shown on the microbit link. If students don't have a background in coding, or if the teacher is uncomfortable in this field, the code can be downloaded from the above link.

## REVIEW
Share guitars and discuss what went well and what needs to be modified.
