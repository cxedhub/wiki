## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Introduction to the GenCyber Hand concepts - also includes Confidentiality topics.


### PRE/POST-TEST
1. Is a password the same as a passphrase?
2. What’s one potential problem that could result from the use of public WiFi?
3. Is cybersecurity only electronic and online, or are there other non-electronic considerations?


### OBJECTIVES
1. Understand the six “hand” concepts of cybersecurity. 2. Describe the concept of confidentiality within the context of Cybersecurity.


### CATCH/HOOK
According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the total cost of cyber-crime is expected to reach 8 Trillion dollars in 2023.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pre-assessment (5-10 minutes): Students respond to pretest questions in a suitable manner (class discussion, response system, etc)


Introduction (30-40 minutes): Brief introduction of the cybersecurity hand names concepts.


Bearcat Name Generator (10-15 minutes): Students will be given the Bearcat Name Generator handout and each student will determine their Bearcat name comprised of a combination of their birth date, last 4 digits of their phone number, and their birth year. The year and dates will be mapped to specific word (add attachment). Have students add their Bearcat Name to their Canvas Profile.


Confidentiality Videos and Discussion (30 minutes): View Confidentiality video and Jimmy Kimmel video. Discuss


REVIEW
Review hand concepts by going over each finger and what it represents. Ask students to share what each represents.


POST-TEST
Is a password the same as a passphrase?


What’s one potential problem that could result from the use of public WiFi?


Is cybersecurity strict electronic and online, or are there other non-electronic  considerations?
