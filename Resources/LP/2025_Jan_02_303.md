# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is an introductory lesson to the problem-solving process.  The goal is for students to see that they, in a manner similar to computers, engage in a process of input, processing, deciding, and acting.  It will serve as an introduction to both my Problem Solving elective as well as an introductory look at computer science.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
When you have a choice to make, explain how you usually do this?  How do you know if the choice you made was correct, or the best choice for the situation?  Is there a way for you to make better informed choices?
## OBJECTIVES
Identify input, processing, determining action, and taking action through personal experience, example situations provided by the teacher, and by examining computer processes.


## CATCH/HOOK
We will work with microbit simulators to define each step of the process before we move into the 'human' portion of the lesson.  Students will get some 'play' time with the simulators while seeing how they can 'think' like computers.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The lesson will begin with a QuickWrite: students will respond to the pretest questions.  Answers will be shared, voluntarily, in the group. (7 minutes)  The teacher will share a basic problem solving model - input, process, decide, act - defining each aspect.  Students will each receive a graphic organizer of the model. (7 minutes)  Then, students and teacher will go to microbit.org and code basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division applications.  The teacher will explain how the computer follows the same problem solving model. (10 minutes).  The teacher will then give each student a worksheet with five different real-life scenarios.  Example: You and your friend are going to the theater.  You want to see a great new action movie, but your friend wants to go see a comedy.  What is your input?  What do you process?  What decision do you choose?  What action would you take?  The teacher and class will do the first example together, then students will do the remaining four on their own.  The teacher and class will share and discuss examples. (25 minutes)  To wrap up the lesson, the students' Exit Ticket will be to respond to the post test questions. (7 minutes)

## REVIEW
To wrap up the lesson, the students' Exit Ticket will be to respond to the post test questions. (7 minutes)  This lesson will also be reviewed at the beginning of the next Problem Solving class to reinforce this particular problem solving approach.
