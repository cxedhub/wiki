# Lesson Plan
## Overview
•        Observe the conductivity strength between different types of bonds, metallic, ionic and covalent. •        Program a Microbit to test the electrical conductivity of different materials.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre and Post Assessment Questions:
1) In your own words, explain why some materials conduct and other don’t. 
2)  If more material is used, will this cause the Microbit to show that this material conducts?
3) Explain why water conducts sometime and not others.
4) Explain if your diet should consist of all three types of chemical bonds, metallic, covalent and ionic bonds?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores the natural world using microprocessors.  They will study the phenomenon of conductivity.  Students will create an experiment that uses Microbit, probes and different material that do or don’t conduct.  They will program a Microbit to either light up for strong, low or no conductivity. Students can then evaluate the difference between metallic, ionic and covalent bonds.


## CATCH/HOOK
Can a microbit cause a piece of aluminum to conduct electricity?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will program a Microbit to either light up for strong, low or no conductivity. They can then evaluate the difference between metallic, ionic and covalent bonds using a Microbit.

## REVIEW
This activity is used to help re-enforce how different chemical bonds conduct electricity.  Another teachable concept is dissociation of ionic bonds.
