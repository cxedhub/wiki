title: Daily Life Algorithms (1st Grade)
description: The teacher will present a slideshow outlining the definition of an algorithm, which will provide examples of algorithms used in daily life. After the slideshow and discussion, students will be given some sheets of paper that have daily life steps on them (making toast, daily routine in the morning, washing hands). The students will use scissors and cut out each picture (step) to each algorithm and place them in the correct order, drawing arrows or numbers to indicate what order the pictures go in. A teacher will check their work before the students glue the pictures (steps) onto their paper. After the cut/paste activity, the teacher will bring the class back together and review the definition of the word algorithm and ask students to provide more daily life examples of algorithms.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
The teacher will present a slideshow outlining the definition of an algorithm, which will provide examples of algorithms used in daily life. After the slideshow and discussion, students will be given some sheets of paper that have daily life steps on them (making toast, daily routine in the morning, washing hands). The students will use scissors and cut out each picture (step) to each algorithm and place them in the correct order, drawing arrows or numbers to indicate what order the pictures go in. A teacher will check their work before the students glue the pictures (steps) onto their paper. After the cut/paste activity, the teacher will bring the class back together and review the definition of the word algorithm and ask students to provide more daily life examples of algorithms.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The teacher will present a slideshow outlining the definition of an algorithm, which will provide examples of algorithms used in daily life. After the slideshow and discussion, students will be given some sheets of paper that have daily life steps on them (making toast, daily routine in the morning, washing hands). The students will use scissors and cut out each picture (step) to each algorithm and place them in the correct order, drawing arrows or numbers to indicate what order the pictures go in. A teacher will check their work before the students glue the pictures (steps) onto their paper. After the cut/paste activity, the teacher will bring the class back together and review the definition of the word algorithm and ask students to provide more daily life examples of algorithms.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Has anyone heard of the word algorithm' or 'Does anyone know what the word algorithm means?' 'Did you know that we complete many different algorithms each day?'
## OBJECTIVES
give a grade appropriate definition of the word algorithm, correctly place pictures depicting real life algorithms in the correct order/sequence using arrows or numbers, and give examples of more real life algorithms other than the ones in the assignment.


## CATCH/HOOK
Today, we are going to learn about what algorithms are. Believe it or not, you follow algorithms all the time. Isn't that surprising for such a strange word? You will soon find out what I mean by this.'

## REVIEW
After the students have completed the cut/paste activity of the lesson, the whole group will come back together and the teacher will review the meaning of the word 'algorithm' and/or ask the students to explain the meaning of the word. In addition, while talking with the whole group, the teacher will ask the students if they can provide other examples of daily life algorithms. Connections will be made to the students' coding program, Kodable.
