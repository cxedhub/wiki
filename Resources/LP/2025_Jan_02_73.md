# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will draw a sight word card and then program either a kibo or bee bot to knock down the matching bowling pin.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What does the Kibo or Bee Bot need in order to knock down the correct bowling pin?
What can/did you do if the Kibo or Bee Bot did not knock down the correct bowling pin?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to read the sight words.
Students will be able to code/program the kibo or bee bot to knock down the correct bowling pin.


## CATCH/HOOK
Using the Kibo or Bee Bots will give them an engaging new way to practice their sight words.  It will also give them an opportunity to practice their coding and problem solving strategies.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Quick reminder of how to code the kibo or bee bot.
Have students draw a sight word card and read it out loud.
Then they will code their kibo or beebot to knock over the matching bowling pin.
They will repeat this process for several sight words. (This can be done as a group, in pairs, or on their own.
