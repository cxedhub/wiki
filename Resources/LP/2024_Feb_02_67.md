# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson you will be introducing the connection of color with computer science through the use of a micro:bit and RGB LED strip(instructions below on how to make it).  This type of output component is incredibly engaging for students since they can create and adjust the properties of light through various colors and sequences.  At the end of the lesson; students will design and prototype a light strip for usage in a rock concert.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How does a computer show color? 
What does color indicate to us as a user?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will understand the principles of light and color codes in computer science.
Students will be able to sequence, adjust, and control an RGB light strip as an output for a computational artifact.


## CATCH/HOOK
Show this video to your students for a connection of how computer science is used to generate various light effects for a concert. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp0i3-FCWhw


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Follow through with the attached presentation.  This will guide the students through the following. 
Day 1 – Introduction/Exploration
•        (1 minute) Objectives
•        (1 minute) Pair Programming Reminder – This is a strategy that I use in my classroom and proven beneficial for students who are beginner programmers.
•        (5 minutes) Opening Questions
o        What does color indicate to us as a user?
        Think about your reaction when seeing a stoplight, emoji, or firework
o        How does a computer show color? 
        Through the use of RGB and HEX codes – I utilize this tool(https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) when showing how to create codes for color. 
•        (6 minutes) Use the linked video in the presentation as a hook for the students.  The video shows how lighting engineers use a system for special effects within a Metallica concert. The video is ~6 minutes long and it isn’t necessary to watch it all. 
•        (5 minutes) Talk to your students about how color is through the light strip.  Use the embedded link to show how to create new colors. 
•        (10 – 15 minutes) Open up MakeCode and run through a live programming session with your students on how to use an RGB light strip as an output. If you do not feel comfortable doing this then show slides (7-8) and have the students explore in pairs.
•        (Remaining Time) Pass out the LED strips to the student pairs.  Have them explore the functions within the neopixel library for the remainder of the class.
Day 2 - Challenge
Work with another student to create a new lighting effect for a concert that is going to be coming to town.  Your client has set the criteria for what they want.
•        Button A - sequencing light pattern 
•        Button B - Flashing light effect
•        Button A + B - A unique RGB color is shown (Use https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker)
•        Shake - The grand finally (This is up to you and your partner to decide what happens)

## REVIEW
How can we use this output(RGB light strip) to solutions in other problems.
