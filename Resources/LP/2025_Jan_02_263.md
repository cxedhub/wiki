# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will construct an penguin home to prevent the phase change of an Ice-Cube Penguin. Students will code 2 micro|bit devices to be a radio and receiver to record the temperature inside the penguin home using one micro|bit, and then creating a graphical representation of the temperature change in their penguin home.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will construct an penguin home to prevent the phase change of an Ice-Cube Penguin. Students will code 2 micro|bit devices to be a radio and receiver to record the temperature inside the penguin home using one micro|bit, and then creating a graphical representation of the temperature change in their penguin home.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Were you able to construct an home?
What is the phase change your penguin went through?
How much mass did your penguin lose in 15 minutes?
Were you able to code a radio that would read the temperature, and then send the temperature recording to a receiver?
## OBJECTIVES
Construct an penguin home to prevent the phase change of their Ice-Cube Penguin
Code 2 micro:bit devices to be a radio and receiver to record the temperature inside the igloo.


## CATCH/HOOK
Save South Africa's Penguins! Give them a home.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will read about South Africa's penguin populations and their need for a suitable home. Students will answer questions about the article, and then begin testing different materials to determine which ones will be best to build the penguin's homes out of. Then, students will build their prototype home, and also code 2 micro:bit devices. One device will be a radio - coded to read the temperature inside the home of the penguin and the other a receiver to read the temperature inside of the penguin home.

## REVIEW
Were you able to have a minimum of loss for your penguin? Did you complete the graph?
