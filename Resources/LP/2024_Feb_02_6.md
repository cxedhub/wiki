title: Coding a Story with Ozobots
description: In this lesson, the students will create their own story or use one that's already made, and draw out that story on a poster board with a path to follow. The students will code the route for the Ozobot to take as the story is read. The Ozobot will follow the path and complete the tasks that the students programed it to do while the teacher reads the story.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
In this lesson, the students will create their own story or use one that's already made, and draw out that story on a poster board with a path to follow. The students will code the route for the Ozobot to take as the story is read. The Ozobot will follow the path and complete the tasks that the students programed it to do while the teacher reads the story.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson, the students will create their own story or use one that's already made, and draw out that story on a poster board with a path to follow. The students will code the route for the Ozobot to take as the story is read. The Ozobot will follow the path and complete the tasks that the students programed it to do while the teacher reads the story.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you draw out a story?
Can you code an Ozobot? 
Can the Ozobot follow the path you created?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Create/draw a story on a poster board.
2. Create a code the Ozobot will follow.
3. Watch the Ozobot follow the code as the teacher reads the story.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will show the students a Youtube video of a story that is already drawn out and showing how the Ozobot follows along the story.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will create a story on a poster board and program an Ozobot to follow the story.

## REVIEW
The teacher would want to explain what the students are going to be doing in a step by step way. I would play an example video on YouTube first, then follow up by explaining to the students exactly what you want them to do. 
1.Come up with a story and draw that story on a poster board.
2.Code your Ozobot.
3.Check to see if the Ozobot works and will follow your story (Practice).
4.Have the Ozobot follow along as the teacher will read the story.
