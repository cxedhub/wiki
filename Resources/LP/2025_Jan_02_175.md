# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The students had to use arrows to provide directions for the penguin to take in order to get to the fish without landing on a whale.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you make a code for the penguin to follow without running into a whale
## OBJECTIVES
Develop a code using arrows


## CATCH/HOOK
Penguins eat fish but whales eat penguins.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students are given a table with a penguin at the start and fish at the end.  Random whales are throughtout the table.  The students use arrows telling the penguin which way to go.
