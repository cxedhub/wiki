# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students use Google Sheets to create a drawing and plot the corresponding ordered pairs that they used in their creation.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you create a drawing in the box using ordered pairs?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students will create a drawing that has at least ten pixels colored
2. Students will identify the ordered pairs that match the chosen pixel squares


## CATCH/HOOK
Let's see what drawings you can make!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students use Google Sheets to create a drawing and plot the corresponding ordered pairs that they used in their creation.

## REVIEW
The ordered pairs can be identified and check to see if they match the color and pixel they are located in. If there is not a corresponding ordered pair in the pixel then adjustments are needed.
