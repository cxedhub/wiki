# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This activity teaches students the importance of creating a safe and secure password. In addition, students will also get to learn how hackers or computers can hack passwords. Students will be able to create their own password using a set of guidelines. The passwords they create may be used for accessing their school computers or websites.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a password?
What are some consequences of someone finding out your password?
What should you do if someone discovers your password?
## OBJECTIVES
Define the term 'password' and describe a password's purpose.
Identify strategies for creating and protecting secure passwords
Practice creating a memorable and strong password.


## CATCH/HOOK
What is something in your life that you take steps to protect? Why and how do you protect it? Let's think about when we use devices, like a phone or computer. How do you limit who can access something that you want to protect, and why would you limit access?One of the most common ways to protect your devices and information online is by using a password. A password is a secret string of letters, symbols, and numbers that you can use to restrict who can access something digital. Some passwords, however, are stronger than others because they are harder for someone to figure out. Let's investigate why strong passwords are important and how you can make sure yours are strong. What is a combination lockExplain that you can only open a combination lock by turning the dial in a secret combination of numbers that is hard to guess.
Ask: Do you ever use a combination lock? If so, what for?
Define the key vocabulary term password - a secret word or phrase that some websites require you to type in if you want to visit them.
Explain to students that online passwords are similar to the combinations for a lock. They are secret combinations of letters and numbers that only you know. Passwords keep other people from seeing your private information on the Internet. For example, tell students that passwords allow them to save their points after playing an online game. When they’re older, they will use passwords to do many things, such as keep track of their money or shop online.
Define the key vocabulary term protect - to keep safe.
Explain that knowing how to create powerful passwords will prevent other people from pretending to be them and help them keep their private information and money secure. Passwords protect one’s identity and information.How would you feel if someone else used your password and pretended to be you on one of these sites? For instance, what if someone used your password to steal points that you have collected in a video game?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will learn rules to a safe password as well as make their own.
Dos and Don’ts of a Password  (30 Minutes)
As a class, have students guess if a rule to making a password is a “do” or a “don’t”. 
DO make passwords eight or more characters long. (Longer passwords are harder to crack than shorter ones.)
DON’T use dictionary words as your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DO include letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. (It can be harder to guess passwords with this combination.)
DO change your password at least every six months. (This way, even if someone does guess your password, they won’t be able to get into your account for long.)
DON’T use private identity information in your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DON’T use your phone number as your password. (Others could guess your password this way.)
DON’T use your nickname as your password. (It could be easy for others to guess.)
DO give your password to your parent or guardian. (They will help you remember it if you forget it.)
DON’T share your password with your friends. (Even if you trust them, they might unintentionally do something that puts you or your information at risk.)
DO create a password that you can remember. (It’s okay to create a random password, but keep in mind that it should be one that you can remember, or else it won’t do you much good.)
Ask: Which tips did you know? Which ones surprised you?
Have students get into groups and discuss these two scenarios for DOs and DON’Ts:
Amy forgets their phone on the bus. IF someone found it and figured out their password to unlock it, THEN what could happen? 
Henry writes their email address in their notebook and leaves it open while they go to the bathroom. IF someone saw Henry’s email address and figured out their email password, THEN what could happen? 


Have students play the Password Protect game in Digital Passport™ by Common Sense Education. This will help introduce key concepts of this lesson. https://www.digitalpassport.org/password-protect.html 
Have students create their own password! Give each student four black cards / pieces of paper. For these papers, have students write down their favorite number, cartoon character’s name, food, and a random symbol. 
Let students play the “test your password” game which can be found at https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2
Assessment (15 Minutes)
Give out the Powerful Passwords Assessment found here: https://curriculum.code.org/csf-19/coursec/2/#powerful-passwords2 
Finish by asking students some ways they can avoid password theft and what they can do in the event that it happens.
