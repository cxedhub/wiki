# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson will show students how computer coding is used to solve the problem of quickly accessing books using the online catalogs present in their school and public libraries.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do we solve the problem of quickly sorting through thousands of books in a library to find just the ones we want?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to explain the basics of how coding is used to power an online library catalog.
Students will be able to use their school or public library online catalog to quickly access the books they want.


## CATCH/HOOK
Either show the slide of a pile of books from the PowerPoint or physically gather a huge pile of books and ask the students want problem they see with this system.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson will show students how computer coding is used to solve the problem of quickly accessing books using the online catalogs present in their school and public libraries.

## REVIEW
This is a PowerPoint presentation that should be combined with student practice using the online library catalog specific to their school.
