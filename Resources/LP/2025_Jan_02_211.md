title: E is for Erosion, C is for Cybersecurity
description: Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, students will be introduced to different ways to keep themselves safe on from cyber threats.  To connect the two components, we are saying that the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will create a slideshow and come up with a plan to avoid cybersecurity breeches in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, students will be introduced to different ways to keep themselves safe on from cyber threats.  To connect the two components, we are saying that the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will create a slideshow and come up with a plan to avoid cybersecurity breeches in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, students will be introduced to different ways to keep themselves safe on from cyber threats.  To connect the two components, we are saying that the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will create a slideshow and come up with a plan to avoid cybersecurity breeches in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is erosion and some examples of erosion?
What are some examples of a cybersecurity threat?
How can you try to avoid a cybersecurity threat?
Give some examples of what could happen to a community with a major security breech?
## OBJECTIVES
explain what erosion is and build a demonstration of erosion.  They will also be able to tell different type of cybersecurity threats and give ways to keep safe on the Internet.

## REVIEW
Students will present their ideas with a Google Slideshow on how the cybersecurity problem could have been avoided and the domino effect of the security breech.
