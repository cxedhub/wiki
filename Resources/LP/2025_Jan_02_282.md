# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this activity, students continue their exploration of weather. They learn about two new weather tools- a wind sock and an anemometer.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Describe how weather and climate are connected.
If you could live in any climate zone, which climate zone would you choose? Why would you choose this climate zone?
## OBJECTIVES
Compare and contrast weather and climate and use grade-level appropriate understanding of mathematics to analyze data.


## CATCH/HOOK
Show windsock and digital anemometer. Ask students if they know what these tools are.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Day 1
Lead a discussion about how to measure the wind speed and direction. (10 minutes)
                How can you tell when the wind is blowing? What do you observe?
                How do you think wind speed can be measured?
                When would it be important to know the wind speed and direction?
Show the windsock and the digital anemometer. Explain how to use the tools.
                Windsock: 
                        Ask: Where have you seen this before?
                        Demonstrate how to extend the telescopic pole
                        Clip the windsock to the end of the pole.
                        Use a compass or a compass app to locate true north for your location.
                        Face true north and hold up the pole.
                Digital Anemometer:
                        Demonstrate how to turn on and off.
Demonstrate how to collect wind data. (40 minutes)
Wrap up with a partner and share what they learned today. (2 minutes)
Day 2
Divide the class into eight groups. Assign groups based on the weather tools:
                Rain gauge
                Thermometer
                Digital Anemometer
                Wind Sock
Go outside and collect weather information. (20 minutes)
In the classroom, have each group share their weather data. Guide students to record the precipitation, temperature, wind direction, and wind speed on the weather calendar. (15 minutes)
Lead a discussion to gather students’ preconceptions about climate.
Prompts for the discussion:
                Why do you think it is important to gather weather data over a long period?
                What do you think the term climate means? Why do you think that?
                How do you think climate and weather are related? (15 minutes)
Watch Climate Zone video (5 minutes)
Day 3
Rewatch Climate Zone Video (5 minutes)
        Discuss the video prompts:
                How is climate different from weather?
                What are the five climate zones? Here have students fill out the graphic organizer in the Launch Log p.7 as the discussion is being held
                What climate zone do we live in? What evidence do you have that this zone fits where we live?
                How would your life change if you lived in a different climate zone? (45 minutes)
