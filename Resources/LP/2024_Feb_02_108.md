# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This activity requires students to conceptualize a mathematical process into a flow chart. Then they will use said flow chart as a map to create and escape room in various formats.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can a student create a flow chart that can be followed to come to a reasonable conclusion.
## OBJECTIVES
1. Identify complex, interdisciplinary, real-world problems that can
be solved computationally.
2. 3.2 Decompose complex real-world problems into manageable subproblems that could integrate existing solutions or procedures.
This might be a reach:
3. Systematically test computational artifacts by considering all
scenarios and using test cases.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will introduce this by giving the children an escape room activity in google forms.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be asked to select one topic learned since the beginning of the year. Sample topics might include unit rate, linear equations, one or two variable equations, Pythagorean theorem, distance formula, surface area, volume, mean absolute deviation, etc. They will then be asked to create a flow chart demonstrating how to solve said problem. This will be presented as a poster or another non-digital form.

## REVIEW
Students will be asked to rate each project utilizing a rubric I have not yet created.
