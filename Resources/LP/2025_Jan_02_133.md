# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Sharing and receiving kindness is a good way to support your well-being and that of your friends. In this activity you will use the radio function of the micro|bit to send a smile to a friend.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can you code a micro:bit to display a smile (or other symbol of kindness)?
How can you code a micro:bit to send your symbol to one other classmate?
What impact does this technology have on well being and how  does sending positive messages impact our community?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will code their micro:bit to display a smile (or other symbol of kindness).
Students will code their micro:bit to send their symbol to one other classmate.
Students will discuss the impact of computing on well being and how positive messages can impact our community.


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine if you could send an encouraging message to a friend using a micro:bit!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This program uses the micro:bit's radio feature to share a smile. You can use it in the MakeCode simulator or flash the code on to 2 or more micro:bits.


First, set the radio group to 2. Groups are like channels, so any micro:bit using the same group will get the smile. You can use any group number you like from 0-255.


When you press button A, it sends a radio text message 'smile'. It also clears the screen so you can send another smile.


When it receives a radio message, it shows a smile emoji on the LED display.


The combination of radio group and the text of the radio message sent make up a protocol: a set of rules for how two devices communicate.

## REVIEW
How  does radio communication between electronic devices use protocols to ensure messages are routed correctly?
How can technology and electronic communication be used for good?
