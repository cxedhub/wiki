# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson will help students gain familiarity with algorithms and how to create a path on a coding mat. This will help prepare students to begin coding online.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm and how do we use them?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will recognize an algorithm, create one and write it down in an unplugged activity.


## CATCH/HOOK
How do we use algorithms in our daily life?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (sets of
step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks. Students can create
and follow algorithms for making simple foods, brushing their teeth, getting
ready for school, or participating in clean-up time
