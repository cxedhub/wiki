# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson will discuss the importance of using a unique username, and help create a strong password using a Caesar Cipher. This lesson will also explain what a Caesar Cipher is and how to decipher it.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. Can you create a unique username?
2. What is a unique username?
3. Can you create a strong password?
4. What is a strong password? 
5. What is a cipher?
6. Can you decipher a password?
## OBJECTIVES
Create unique usernames that they can use later, Create a strong password using a Caesar Cipher, and Decipher someone's password.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will show the students the Caesar Cipher code I want them to use. We will then go into a discussion on the importance of a unique username and strong password.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Have a discussion on what a unique username is.
2. Have the students create a unique username.
3. Have a discussion on creating a strong password.
4. Explain what a Caesar Cipher is.
5. Have the students create their own password using the Caesar Cipher.
6. Partner up with someone and share your password and try to decipher each other's password.
7. Have a discussion on keeping our passwords safe and secure.
