# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson introduces the concept of sending bits of information from one place to another.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can information be sent from one place to another?
## OBJECTIVES
Explain how the same piece of information can be represented in a variety of different ways. 
Use a device to represent different pieces of information Use patterns to represent information


## CATCH/HOOK
Hands on physical computing element.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will build a program that will transfer data from one point to another using micro:bits to use symbols representing answers to ever increasingly harder questions.

## REVIEW
Wrap up by discussing how you used the Micro:Bits and what that means about the questions you can ask and the messages you can send. 


Discussion Goal: Focus the discussion on how each group chose to program their Micro:Bits to be able to indicate and pass on the answer to their questions.
Ultimately, groups begin to notice that there are multiple ways for information to be passed and if the information is passed correctly then each different way used is appropriate.
