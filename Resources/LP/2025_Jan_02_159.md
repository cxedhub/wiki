# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The lesson is for coding with micro|bits. It is written broadly for implementation as an activity for a whole group of students in a library/makerspace club or as a free-choice activity for small groups or individuals. However, it can be adapted for collaborative teaching to support various classroom curricula.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
List and describe each step in the design cycle.


How can you use coding to accomplish a certain task?
## OBJECTIVES
Students shall be able to create a computational artifact, using the tools and materials provided, through employing the design cycle.


Students shall be able to use software and hardware to explore coding, programming, and data analysis.


## CATCH/HOOK
The librarian will begin by addressing the students with a micro:bit attached as a nametag. The sight of the scrolling name shall intrigue students and give them just a wee taste of what is possible using such a seemingly simple device.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Record Instructional video - forthcoming
Post on library website - forthcoming


Introduce micro:bits with name flashing = “Hello, my name is ...”
Show students that it is possible to activate other programs through other means (Shake the micro:bit for it to read “ Hello, my name remains...”
Introduce micro:bits site
Instruct students in how to gain access to library website and micro:bits site.
Determine purpose:
If working in collaboration with Classroom or Computer Science teacher, outline objectives
If working in Library Club, outline objectives
If allowing exploration during free periods, allow students to explore the materials and encourage them to share their results
Present projects
Review and Reflect -Instruct students to fill out the Google Form - forthcoming
