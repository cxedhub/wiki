title: Making Good Decisions Online/Computer Parts (Kindergarten)
description: In the first activity, with the slideshow displayed, the teacher will facilitate a discussion about making good decisions online and why this is important. After a brief introduction, the teacher will go through the slides and have the students decide which picture shows students making the better decision out of the two pictures on each slide. Students will then have the opportunity to log onto their Chromebooks and display good decision-making while working online (while the teacher observes, making note of behaviors). In the second activity, with the slideshow displayed and an actual Chromebook held up, the teacher will highlight the parts of a Chromebook that students need to familiarize themselves with in order to be able to work independently and solve problems independently on the Chromebook. (Students may or may not be able to hold onto their own Chromebook at this time, depending on the makeup of the class.) These computer parts will be reviewed throughout the year and an appropriate checklist will be used to assess students' knowledge of the parts of a Chromebook.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
In the first activity, with the slideshow displayed, the teacher will facilitate a discussion about making good decisions online and why this is important. After a brief introduction, the teacher will go through the slides and have the students decide which picture shows students making the better decision out of the two pictures on each slide. Students will then have the opportunity to log onto their Chromebooks and display good decision-making while working online (while the teacher observes, making note of behaviors). In the second activity, with the slideshow displayed and an actual Chromebook held up, the teacher will highlight the parts of a Chromebook that students need to familiarize themselves with in order to be able to work independently and solve problems independently on the Chromebook. (Students may or may not be able to hold onto their own Chromebook at this time, depending on the makeup of the class.) These computer parts will be reviewed throughout the year and an appropriate checklist will be used to assess students' knowledge of the parts of a Chromebook.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In the first activity, with the slideshow displayed, the teacher will facilitate a discussion about making good decisions online and why this is important. After a brief introduction, the teacher will go through the slides and have the students decide which picture shows students making the better decision out of the two pictures on each slide. Students will then have the opportunity to log onto their Chromebooks and display good decision-making while working online (while the teacher observes, making note of behaviors). In the second activity, with the slideshow displayed and an actual Chromebook held up, the teacher will highlight the parts of a Chromebook that students need to familiarize themselves with in order to be able to work independently and solve problems independently on the Chromebook. (Students may or may not be able to hold onto their own Chromebook at this time, depending on the makeup of the class.) These computer parts will be reviewed throughout the year and an appropriate checklist will be used to assess students' knowledge of the parts of a Chromebook.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Do you know what it means to be online or make good decisions online?' and 'Do you know what some of the parts on your Chromebook are called?'
## OBJECTIVES
demonstrate appropriate behavior while working online and name the [essential] parts of a Chromebook.


## CATCH/HOOK
There are good ways and not-so-good ways to behave when you are online. We want you to be safe when you are online so let's talk about these ways to behave. We are going to play a little game today.' (make sure the students know what is meant by the term 'online') and 'Your Chromebook has a lot of important parts to it and in order for you to use it, you need to know what those parts are called and what they do.'


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The detailed procedure is attached step-by-step in the attached PDF document.

## REVIEW
What are some other ways we can make good decisions online?' (Allow sharing time.) and 'Does anyone have a Chromebook at home or know any other computer part names that we did not mention today?' (Allow sharing time.)
