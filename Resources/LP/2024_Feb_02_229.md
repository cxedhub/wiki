# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson uses familiar nursery rhymes to introduce secondary students to the concepts of coding, sequencing, and looping with microbits.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are terms used for logic loops?
What is an algorithm?
What is the use of a loop?
What does a for loop do?
What does an if loop do?
## OBJECTIVES
1.  Repeat the rhyme/song back in the correct order.
2.  Define loop, sequence, chain tale.
3.  Construct their own unique and logical loop, complete with rhyming words, if age appropriate.


## CATCH/HOOK
After we read through some familiar nursery rhymes, identify loops and themes that could be used in programming.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Take the physically written code from last lesson and start to plug in to microbits studio.
Work through the problems presented.
The goal is to have a code that reads the nursery rhyme while using loops.
