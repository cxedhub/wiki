## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will be able to demonstrate foundational knowledge and skills that are related to cybersecurity


### PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is your understanding of computer coding? 
2. How can a cyber attack cause issues in emergency management?
3. How does defense in depth mitigate the threat against CI?


### OBJECTIVES
1. Understand basic coding 
2. Understand how a cyber attack can disrupt services 
3. Understand the role of defense in depth


### CATCH/HOOK
Hands on activity using the city board, and they get to virtually "attack" their fellow students' projects


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
●        Lecture “Introduction to Cybersecurity ”
●        Lecture, demonstration, and discussion of the Micro Bit kits, and the https://makecode.microbit.org/ website 
●        Students will have one class period to work on coding and downloading to his/ her Micro Bit. 


Learning Check Day 1 
●        Students will be assigned homework: they will take their Micro Bits kits home and will create another project that they discuss and display to the instructor and fellow students the following academic day. 


Tasks Day 2-Day 5 
●        Students will break down into teams and program a multi-function project on a “team” Micro Bit 
●        Each team will switch programmed Micro Bits and add coding to change the behavior of the other team’s Micro Bit. 
●        Each team will then have their original Micro Bit returned to them. Each team has to identify how the behavior of their Micro Bit has changed, troubleshoot the coding, and repair the coding so that their Micro Bit’s behavior returns to its original state
