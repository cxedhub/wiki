## Lesson Plan
### Overview
This lesson will help students to understand cryptology.  Students will use problem solving skills to encrypt and decrypt messages.  By investigating a shift cipher, students will reinforce their understanding of the concepts of functions and transformations of functions.


### PRE/POST-TEST
What is cryptology?
Are codes and ciphers the same?
Why should we care about it?


### OBJECTIVES
Students  will be able to encrypt a message.
Students  will be able to decrypt a message.
Students  will be able to describe cryptology.


### CATCH/HOOK
The hook will be playing Morse code for students using this website: https://www.mobilefish.com/services/morse_code/morse_code.php


*OR*
The hook will be asking the students to decipher this message:
https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/sliding-scale-or-cryptograph


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Teacher will introduce and describe how cryptology is used and open discussion for students to share knowledge on the topic.


Students will be split into small groups and directed to the following websites to explore encryption techniques: 
https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/block-cipher
https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/code-stick
https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/code-word
https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/pigpen
http://www.happychild.org.uk/ifs/00001pla.htm
http://www.happychild.org.uk/ifs/00003mrs.htm


Class discussion will follow to share out what was found.


Together we will discuss shift ciphers: https://sites.google.com/site/codesforscouts/sliding-scale-or-cryptograph






### REVIEW
Students will then be given a message to encrypt with directions to do so using at least 3 different secret codes.  Students will write their responses on a separate piece of paper.


### STANDARDS        
MA.912.F.2.1 Identify the effect on the graph or table of a given function after replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, for specific values of k.
