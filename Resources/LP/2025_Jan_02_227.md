# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Reading is powerful, it can unlock a world of possibilities. Reading and having others read to us can increase our comprehension and memory. Through this activity we are going to tap into how well students can use their memory of stories to code unplugged using directions as code.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Are you able to code a sequence of images using directional arrows?
## OBJECTIVES
Correctly code the sequence of images using directional arrows


## CATCH/HOOK
Reading each story to appeal to their senses


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I would start this lesson by handing out the brown bear brown bear unplugged coding sheet to each student. I would then ask the class the pretest question. To receive data I would have students respond by thumbs up/ thumbs down to respond. 


After all students respond please read the story Brown Bear, Brown Bear what do you see? While reading, have students try to remember the order that the bear sees the animals. After you are done reading, as a group work your way through the the unplugged worksheet. After you are done with one as a class.


Next, please read The Very Hungry Caterpillar. While reading, have students try to remember the order that the caterpillar eats the food. When you are done reading, pass out the unplugged worksheet that goes with this story and have students work with an elbow partner to complete it together. I would give them 5ish minutes to fill this out. As students are working, walk around and check students' work and help where needed. 


Lastly, please read If You Give a Pig a Pancake. While reading, have students try to remember the order that the pig goes to get its pancake. When you are done reading, pass out the unplugged worksheet that goes with the story and have students work independently on this worksheet. I would give students 7ish minutes to complete this sheet. As students are working, walk around and check students' work and help where needed.


When students are done working, collect all of students papers and ask students their post test question. The majority of answers should be thumbs up.

## REVIEW
In this lesson students have used memory to help them code using directions to finish the code.
