# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be able to create solvable mazes while applying grade-level geometry concepts on Kodable Maze Maker https|//game.kodable.com/hour-of-code#maze-maker
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Match the following coding vocabulary with the appropriate definitions: Algorithm, Sequence, events, loops and conditionals.
## OBJECTIVES
Compare and refine multiple algorithms for the same task. Create programs that include sequences, events, loops, and conditionals. Modify, remix, or incorporate portions of an existing program into one's own work, to develop something new or add more advanced features.


## CATCH/HOOK
Can you create a maze that will stump your friends than take the Maker Maze Challenge.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Once learners are set up with the activity, invite them to start the guided practice levels. These will unlock the Maze Maker
Model how to create a maze for learners, or show this short video 
Go over the challenges listed on the Maze Maker Challenges handout. Tell learners which challenges you want them to complete and options for earlier finishers to continue. 
*Note: Challenges are listed in K-5 order. We suggest having students work on the grade-level appropriate challenges before attempting the rest.
Hand out the Maze Maker challenge handout for students to begin workin

## REVIEW
By randomly selecting different students to try and solve their maze creations.
