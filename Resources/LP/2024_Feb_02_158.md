title: Sequencing = Storytelling
description: This lesson helps learners connect storytelling with simple coding through the study of the sequence of events. It begins with a read-aloud, progresses through unplugged activities in composing algorithms, and ends with story composition and creation using online interfaces. This lesson is designed to occur in the library setting for primary grades but may be adapted for the classroom setting.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson helps learners connect storytelling with simple coding through the study of the sequence of events. It begins with a read-aloud, progresses through unplugged activities in composing algorithms, and ends with story composition and creation using online interfaces. This lesson is designed to occur in the library setting for primary grades but may be adapted for the classroom setting.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Describe, step-by-step and in order, a simple task.


What is the sequence of events of your favorite story?


How effectively are you able to use a computer program to tell a story?
## OBJECTIVES
1 - Describe a simple task or event, step-by-step.


2 - Retell a story in proper sequential order.


3 - Use a computer program (coding, storyboarding, etc.) to describe a task with a proper procedure or to create a story with a beginning, middle, and end.


## CATCH/HOOK
I am a 'Robot Librarian.' I need to demonstrate how to check out a book, but I need to be programmed to do that. I can do only what the programmer tells me. Let's see if we can come up with the best step-by-step directions to get that done.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1st Session:
Read-aloud selected story in selected form
Explain that story sequence will go along with the paired activity
Introduce activity by performing as a “Robot-Librarian”
Students must direct the “Robot-Librarian” in the proper procedure for checking out a book. 
The “Robot-Librarian” can do only as the students direct.
Students must collaborate and cooperate in giving those directions, reflecting and refining along the way.


Pretend the librarian is a robot. Program the librarian to check out a book. 
1. Work in small groups-Brainstorm steps
2. List steps, evaluate, and refine. 
3. Set Librarian into motion.
4. Groups take turns to check if ALL necessary steps are included and are in proper order.


2nd Session:
Review
Explain Objectives, Essential Questions, and Procedures
Hand out “Coding Practice”
Read over directions 
Discuss vocabulary (Algorithm, Coding, Sequencing, Story-Telling)
Move through hand-out’s procedures - I Can/You Can/We Can
Discuss reflections
Check for understanding of vocabulary and concepts
Discuss: 
What other tasks might you be able to describe step-by-step?
Retell a task 
1. Work in small groups-Brainstorm task
2. List steps
3. Evaluate
4. Refine
5. Present


What other stories can you retell, point-by-point?
Retell a story
1. Work in small groups-Brainstorm story.
2. List events
3. Evaluate
4. Refine
5. Present


3rd Session:
Review
Instruct students in logging in to their computers
Instruct students in navigating to the library website
Instruct students in navigating to selected tool (Scratch, StoryboardThat, etc.)
Demonstrate coding capabilities or show tutorial. Procedure
Have students write out or draw a simple procedure of their choice
Allow students to practice coding.
Demonstrate story-telling possibilities or show tutorial. Creation
Have students write out and draw a sequential story - with beginning, middle, end
Allow students to practice storyboarding
Support students in working on the projects.

## REVIEW
Presentation of student projects ; Group discussion to reflect on what went well and what could go better
