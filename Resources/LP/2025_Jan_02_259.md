# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is an unplugged activity, in collaboration with 5th grade, that will help students learn to give directions verbally. Students will be working in mixed grade level teams to navigate an obstacle course blindfolded by giving step by step directions. This will be the first step to learning how to program and use algorithms.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do you get to the cafeteria?
This question will be asked before the activity begins. I expect the directions to be very minimal and non descriptive. At the end of the activity I will ask this question. I will expect more explicit step by step directions from the students. This will lead into coding in the next lesson.
## OBJECTIVES
I can work as a team to give accurate step by step directions to get a blindfolded person through an obstacle course in the least amount of time possible. 
I can talk with my team about the best way to get the blindfolded person through the course the second time faster.


## CATCH/HOOK
After the pre-test question teachers will stand back to back in front of the class. One teacher will demonstrate how to make a paper airplane correctly. While making the paper airplane correctly she will be giving the other teacher vague directions to make their own airplane. The other teacher will follow the directions but not quite right. This will show the student how important specific step by step directions are.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Give the pre-assessment question.
2. Teacher will demonstrate how to make a paper airplane. (Hook see above)
3. Teacher will group students into mixed gradeleve groups of 3-4 students.
4. Students will be assigned jobs. (Competitor, Director, Timer, Facilitator) (The facilitator leads discussions and this job can be combined with the timer if the group only has 3 students.)
5. Facilitator will blindfold the competitor and leave them on the start line. 
6. The remaining group members will go to the collaboration station. A taped off square near the start line where teammates have to discuss and agree on the directions that the director will give to the competitor. 
7. The competitor will specifically follow the directions given by the director to complete the obstacle course. For each direction given the team members will need to meet and agree on the next direction in the collaboration station prior to to competitor moving through the obstacle course.
8. The timer will have a stopwatch and will be timing the length it takes for the competitor to complete the obstacle course and tally how many total directions were given. 
9. Teams will record their time and number of directions given on chart paper (taped to the wall) for each attempt at the obstacle course.  
10. After completing the obstacle course the first time, teams will have an opportunity to discuss possible changes and to change rolls, as will as complete the obstacle course again as time permits. Repeat directions 5-9.

## REVIEW
Ask the post question and group discussion regarding what went well and what could be changed.
