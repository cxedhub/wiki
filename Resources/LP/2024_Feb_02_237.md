# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will create an online microbit “project” about basic multiplication and array’s. The project will focus on one multiplication, division, and array equation. This lesson will be a great introduction to students just learning to become fluent with their multiplication and division math facts.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
-What is a microbit?
-How can a microbit be used to show multiplication, division, and array images?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will create an online microbit “project” about basic multiplication and array’s. The project will focus on one multiplication, division, and array equation. This lesson will be a great introduction to students just learning to become fluent with their multiplication and division math facts.


## CATCH/HOOK
Candy array warm-up activity


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Activate Schema: Based on what vocabulary we know so far, what does multiplication, array, and division mean? 
        Multiplication: Equal groups
        Division: Separating groups
        Array: A method of showing the total of two numbers by using rows and columns. 
Today we will be using a microbit to demonstrate one multiplication, division, and array example! 
Questions: 
-What is a microbit?
-How can a microbit be used to show multiplication, division, and array images? 


Process: 
Airplay or Cast your computer screen to show the steps and the process using microbit
MICROBIT PROJECT STEPS: 
You will use the tabs: Basic, Input, and Math 
On start
Show string “Hello”
Pause 2000 ms
Show Icon X (stands for multiplication in this sequence) 
Clear Screen 
Show string “7 x 8”
Pause 5000 ms
Clear screen
Show number (7x8) the number 56 will appear
Pause 5000 ms
Clear screen
Show string “56/8”
Pause 5000 ms
Clear screen 
Show string “56/8” the number 7 will appear 
Download
Click and Drag onto USB desktop 


ARRAY MICROBIT PROJECT STEPS: 
You will use the tabs: Basic, Input, Math, Array 
On start
Show string “hello”
Clear Screen
Show image: 4x4 array 
Pause 5000 ms
Clear screen
Show string “4 x 4” 
Pause 5000 ms
Clear screen
Show number 16 
Download 
Click and Drag onto USB desktop 




Unplugged Version: Have students create arrays that match basic multiplication and division equations on paper or with other manipulatives.
