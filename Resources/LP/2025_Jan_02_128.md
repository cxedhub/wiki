# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use two different maze websites throughout the lesson. They will use speaking and listening skills to exit the mazes. They will write their directions down and see if a partner is able to follow the directions to escape.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Have you ever solved a maze?
What do you need to know in order to solve a maze?
Do your directions allow for another person to escape a maze?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to give their partner oral and written directions.
Students will collaborate to escape each maze.


## CATCH/HOOK
Have you ever completed a maze in a book or on a piece of paper? 
Have you ever been in a real-life maze that you tried to escape from? 
How did you know what to do to get out of the maze and find the exit?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Ask students catch/hook questions and have them answer using Timed Pair Share
2. Open up the mazegame.org website and read the about info to students
3. Have each student try the website on their own until they are each able to solve Level 1
4. Partner students up
5. Tell them that they will first orally give directions to their partner to help them escape Level 2 of the maze. Have each partner take turns doing that.
6. Then, for Level 3, they will write down directions that their partner will follow to escape the maze.

## REVIEW
Peer reflection- what did you learn? What went well (peaks)? What would you change (valleys)?
Now, go to the second website- toytheater.com/maze
Have students compare and contrast the two websites
