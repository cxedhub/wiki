# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson series, students will research ways that technology has impacted the world. They can choose to research people or specific systems. After their small projects are completed, students will have a chance to present their project in a 'museum' fashion.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How has technology impacted the world?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students will be able to recall and share information about how computers have impacted society.
2. Students will be able to find and apply information pertaining to their research project.
3. Students will be able to write a 1 paragraph essay about a specific topic including 3 key ideas and 1 supporting fact for each.


## CATCH/HOOK
Have students look at their devices on their desks, really study them. Then have them share in writing and with a table partner what things that device has helped them with.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will start by choosing their topic from the prepared options. Have a mix of technology and inventors. 
To make this unplugged, have prepared reading packets or books that support the topics that they can look for.
After students have chosen their topic, they will start working on their research and their research “brain web” that they will use to inform their writing. They should have three main ideas from their research and one supporting detail for each topic. 
When they have their web they can work on writing their paragraph draft.

## REVIEW
Have students stand up, hands up, pair up, and share 1 thing they learned about their inventor or technology. Then have them turn in their draft and web and line up.
