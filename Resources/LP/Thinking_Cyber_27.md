## Lesson Plan
### Overview
I intend to use the idea of Cyber Security to introduce safe processes when preparing for my class, I do a break-up DBQ which follows a students relationship which I will add the security portion to, and last hitting Modern World History in terms of the new non-traditional battle space not in the traditional set piece way (tanks & foot soldiers)


### PRE/POST-TEST
How can I apply knowledge of the Cyber Security framework to improve my critical and historically thinking?


### OBJECTIVES
Students ability to analyze a source by thinking like an adversary, what is confidentiality and how do I maintain or lose it or how is it susceptible, and Keep it Simple (how do you demonstrate something at a high level but keep it simple)


### CATCH/HOOK
So, the reason I used Google Docs was so I could hack your computer...


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
They will receive a DBQ with documents but not a historical DBQ, but a DBQ following a break up of a high school couple filled with text messages, emails, and eye-witness and second hand accounts


They will use that along with their Cyber Security and Historical Thinking skills to begin to formulate a DBQ AP response






### REVIEW
We will break down their finished written product into the elements and mark each students response for review for specific skills if necessary


### STANDARDS        
AP Historical Thinking Skills (Comparative Analysis, Comparison, Continuity & Change)
Advanced Placement (Skills 1 to 6 for Historical Thinking)
