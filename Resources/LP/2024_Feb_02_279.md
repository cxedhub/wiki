# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Bee Boop Bee Boop!  This lesson will explore cryptology and ciphers.  We will reserach the topic using a scavenger hunt that students will be able to dig deep into their thinking and how ciphers work.  Then students will be able to create and decode many ciphers with different keys.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is cybersecurity?
2.What is a cipher?
3.Who knows who Juleus Cesear is?
3.Have you ever made a secret code with someone
We will take a quizizz pre and post  https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/62d19abbbcbd81001d215643?source=quiz_page
## OBJECTIVES
1.To create and solve ciphers using logical reasoning
2.Summarize research


## CATCH/HOOK
I will teach like a pirate and where a costume to reflect the topic and then give each student a secret handshake as they enter the room.
I will show students a clip around secret code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1uBnt2V0V0


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This will be a single day (50 minutes) lesson used in my unplugged unit that focuses on basic computer science (what is a computer, how it works, and networks).  Students will be introduced to cryptology and ciphers.  Later in the semester they will end up coding actual ciphers.
Students will watch a video of Jimmy Falon and the Beibs secretly handshaking.  This will be the segue to our content.  I will go over the rubric for the activity.  
Students will have half the period to work on their reserach activity guide individually.  They will have to share their thinking with a peer their findings when I stop the activity.  I will use a digital randomizer to pair them up for different questions.
Next students will work with a partner of their choice.  I will show the video on Cesear Cipher:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhGkbcQ7TT0&list=PL4R2kry1ttMKkJVw2Xf1nN_s4Apuunt2J&index=8
Students will work together to decode and encrypt messages.  They will create three codes to challenge other students.
We will wrap up with the quizizz.

## REVIEW
I will review the rubric and students will take the quizizz mentioned earlier.  Later in the semester students will code a cipher on their microbits.
