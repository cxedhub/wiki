# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson, as adapted and written, is for middle school students in the library setting. Students will explore algorithms to perform simple tasks. Then they will explore online coding tools in order to retell a story.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Why is being able to follow directions important?


Why is being able to recognize a sequence of events important?


How are algorithms like directions?


How is coding like story-telling?
## OBJECTIVES
Students shall describe a simple task or event, step-by-step.


Students shall retell a story in proper sequential order.


Students shall use a computer program (coding, storyboarding, etc.) to describe a task with a proper procedure or to create a story with a beginning, middle, and end.


## CATCH/HOOK
The Librarian is a robot. Students must direct (program) the robot-librarian in the correct sequence for checking out a book to a student. Any misstep, and the student can't take their chosen book.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1st Session
Explain Objectives, Essential Questions, and Procedures
Introduce activity by performing as a “Robot-Librarian”
Students must direct the “Robot-Librarian” in the proper procedure for checking out a book. 
The “Robot-Librarian” can do only as the students direct.
Students must collaborate and cooperate in giving those directions, reflecting and refining along the way.
Pretend the librarian is a robot. Program the librarian to check out a book. 
Work in small groups-Brainstorm steps
List steps, evaluate, and refine. 
Set Librarian into motion.
Groups take turns to check if ALL necessary steps are included and are in proper order.


2nd Session
Review
Explain Objectives, Essential Questions, and Procedures
Hand out “Coding Practice”
Read over directions 
Discuss vocabulary (Algorithm, Coding, Sequencing, Story-Telling)
Move through hand-out’s procedures - I Can/You Can/We Can
Discuss reflections
Check for understanding of vocabulary and concepts
Discuss: 
What other tasks might you be able to describe step-by-step?
Retell a task 
Work in small groups-Brainstorm task
List steps
Evaluate
Refine
Present


What stories can you retell, point-by-point?
Retell a story
Work in small groups-Brainstorm story.
List events
Evaluate
Refine
Present


3rd Session
Review
Instruct students in logging in to their computers
Instruct students in navigating to the library website
Instruct students in navigating to selected tool (Scratch, StoryboardThat, Code.org Sprite Lab, etc.)
Demonstrate coding capabilities or show tutorial. Procedure
Have students write out or draw a simple procedure of their choice
Allow students to practice coding.
Demonstrate story-telling possibilities or show tutorial. Creation
Have students write out and draw a sequential story - with beginning, middle, end
Allow students to practice storyboarding
Support students in working on the projects.


Present projects
Review and Reflect

## REVIEW
Project presentation and revisit of essential questions:
Why is being able to follow directions important?


Why is being able to recognize a sequence of events important?


How are algorithms like directions?


How is coding like story-telling?
