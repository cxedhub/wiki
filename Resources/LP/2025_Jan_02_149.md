# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand.  This is the first of a three lesson unit that introduces 5th grade computer users of how we protect personal information from various forms of cyber attacks..  The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Social Studies, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can we protect ourselves from cyber attacks?
## OBJECTIVES
1.  Students will draft a multimedia presentation that address the following:
        A.  Researched definition of cyber security with 100% accuracy.
        B.  Noting at least three areas that can be impacted by cyber attacks with 100% 
             accuracy.
        C. Describe with 100% accuracy the role technology plays from a social studies 
            standpoint in terms of needs, wants, goods, and services.


## CATCH/HOOK
What are things that can CRASH?  Today's focus begins with listing things that crash!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Real World Cybersecurity (45 minutes):
        10 min.  Students get out white boards and quietly generate lists of things that crash.
                Students walk about the room for pairing, sharing, and adding to their lists.


Whole group discussion about lists, zeroing in on common findings until 
the topic of computer crashes arise.  Discuss the causes for computers crashing 
and introduce the daily focus of protection from cyber attacks with cyber security..


Introduce/revisit the social studies concept that define needs, wants, goods, and 
services.  Student divide their individual white boards into four sections;  “Needs, 
Wants, Goods, and Services.”  Teacher randomly calls out (pre-generated) terms 
that fit in one of the four categories, with students discussing and placing the 
terms into the correct category on their white boards.   After each a category has 
a couple of items, turn focus to technology and/or computer science terms that 
will fit into each category, with “cyber security” being the last term to place.  (The 
big idea is for students to see that technology fits in each category and the final term “cyber security” segues into the main activity) 


5 min  Teacher leads discussion of the job description of someone who works in cyber 
security, beginning with the very first thing a person in cyber security does once 
they get into the office; login to their computer, just like we do at school. Watch 3 minute video and take notes (on white boards) about Two Factor Authentication; how it works and why it’s useful.  https://www.trendmicro.com/internet-safety/for-kids/cyber-academy/what-is-two-factor-authentication


        25 min Creation of CyberSecurity Powerpoint or Google Slide Presentation
                Students follow teacher model of creating Google Slide, titling it “Cyber Security,” 
and sharing it with teacher.  Teacher then models first slide creation of how technology fits into needs, wants, goods, and services; being sure to include that “Cyber Security” fits into “service.”  Teacher and students construct slide two together about “Two Factor Authenticity” with the use of students’ notes.  Teacher gives instruction that student partners will watch and note three videos, then create another slide using information from the videos.
