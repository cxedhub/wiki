## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will be provided a scenario. In this scenario, a student is applying to a college. They have created an application essay based upon the following prompt: Described a time where you have either been inspired by, or inspired someone else. How did this impact you? 
For this essay, before they submit it to the college, they want to share it with their friend. How can they ensure someone else does not steal their essay and use it as their own?


### PRE/POST-TEST
What strategies did the group suggest? Why/why not do you think these are effective ways to maintain the security of the document? Why is cybersecurity important in this scenario? How does this connect to our discussion about things like “Tiktok,” and “Instragram?”


### OBJECTIVES
Ech group will need to come to a consensus on how to keep steps needed to keep the document safe from others, while also being able to share it with their friend to peer edit. This will be done in a 3-5 minute presentation, so they will need to have at least 3 steps included to keep the document safe.


### CATCH/HOOK
Through discussions I have had with my students, I found out that they will need to write either an essay for a college application or put together a resume. These are both very important digital documents which need to be kept safely secured.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
We will begin with a class discussion about social media and the importance of cyber security. I want to ensure they not only have an understanding of the term, but also how it connects to a lot of things they do on a day-to-day basis. Next, they will be provided the scenario and have time in their group to brainstorm their ideas, before adding it to their presentation.






### REVIEW
Students will provide additional examples of other times where cyber security is important to think about and implement, and then the future impact what they are posting can have.
