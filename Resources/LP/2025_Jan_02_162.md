# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson provides robotics opportunities in the library for students with complex needs in the Functional Life Skills(FLS) Program. After structured introduction of various concepts and demonstration of different tools, students shall have the opportunity to explore coding and programming. Students shall then share their ideas regarding robotics and what its concepts and tools can do to impact our lives.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What 3-d shapes do you know?


How do we write code to program a robots and control its movements?


How do you program a robot to perform a task or do something useful?
## OBJECTIVES
Students shall be able to identify and describe 3-D shapes


Students shall be able to write block code to program a robot, using the tools and materials provided.


Students shall be able to operate a robot to perform various tasks, solving problems that arise.


## CATCH/HOOK
Display robots and tools on the tables, welcoming students into the library and inviting them to have a look over the tools available. Their eyes will light up!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Let students know that they will be investigating Robots: building robots, coding robots, programming robots, and using virtual robots.
Discuss with students what a robot is and what it does.
Introduce vocabulary (coding, programming, virtual, 3-Dimensional Shapes: cube, cone, cylinder, rectangular prism, etc.).
Read 'Stem: Robots: 3-D Shapes' by Joseph Otterman on epic!.
Start designing and building simple robots with blocks, going over shapes.
As a class, complete “Problem Solving” assessment - Robots, p. 20 & Math talk p. 25.
Allow students opportunity to build robot kits, focusing on shapes.
Introduce students to Osmo - Coding Awbie.
Allow students opportunity to explore Awbie on Osmo along with other Osmo apps.
Introduce students to Code-a-pillar
Allow students opportunity to explore Code-a-pillar and its coding capabilities.
Introduce students to Botley 
Allow students opportunity to explore Botley and its coding capabilities.
Introduce students to Botzees and its app.
Allow students opportunity to explore Botzee and its coding capabilities.
Introduce students to Sphero and its app.
Allow students opportunity to explore Sphero and its coding capabilities.
Discuss with students ways robots help us.
Discuss with students their ideas for the future of robots.
Have students present their robots and projects.
Instruct students to complete the Reflection Form
