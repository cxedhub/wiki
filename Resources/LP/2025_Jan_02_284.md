# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this activity, students explore the three factors that affect weather| precipitation, temperature, and wind. Students learn how meteorologists use weather tools to collect data. They learn how to measure precipitation with a rain gauge and how to measure temperature with a thermometer.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do the three weather factors impact your local area?   Why is it important for meteorologists to collect weather data?
## OBJECTIVES
Analyze the effects of weather and understand how weather data is collected and interpreted.


## CATCH/HOOK
On chart paper fill out a KWL chart of what the students know about the weather.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Day 1
Individual Think Time: Have students think about what they know about the weather in preparation for a discussion. (3 minutes)
Beforehand, prepare a chart and make a KWL chart. Students will discuss their thoughts and the teacher will write on the KWL chart. (10 minutes)
Read story Weather Worries (10 minutes)
Students will use the link below to answer questions independently about weather in their Launch Logs pages 3 & 4. 
https://instructional-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/PLTW_Launch/10045_WeatherFactorsAndHazards/English_External_Files/3_5_Intro_to_Weather/index.html
                Prompts for discussion after viewing video:
How does this connect to your life?
                What are the three weather factors? What weather factors have you experienced?
                What tools do meteorologists use to measure weather factors? How do these tools help them? (30 minutes)
Wrap up with a partner and share what they learned today. (2 minutes)
Day 2
Review vocabulary words of meteorologist, precipitation, temperature, weather, wind, meteorologist, rain gauge, thermometer. (10 minutes)
Review the discussion you had after the video. Add the following prompts
                How do meteorologists measure weather factors?
                Do they use the same tools to measure each factor? Why do you think it is important for them to use different tools?
                Can two people measure different amounts of rainfall from the same rain storm? Can wind speed and wind direction vary depending on where they are measured? Why do you think this?
Show the rain gauge. Ask if anyone has captured rain in a container during a rainstorm.
                Discuss how the rain gauge measures rain by capturing the water that falls through the opening.
                The rain gauge must be placed in an open space so the rain is not blocked.
                Model the correct way to collect data with a rain gauge. Determine whether you will use the millimeter or inch scale to record volume.
                        Fill the rain gauge half full with water.
                        Hold the rain gauge at eye level.
                        Read the volume of water.
Distribute one thermometer to each group. Ask students whether they have used a thermometer before.
                Demonstrate how to accurately read a thermometer. The liquid in the thermometer and the scale need to be viewed at eye level, not at an angle from above or below.
                Determine whether you will use the Farenheit or Celsius scale to record temperature.
        Guide students to work with their partner to practice reading temperatures at different locations. (30 minutes)
Students will go to Google Classroom and answer the conclusion questions. (15 minutes)
Wrap up with a partner to share about the different tools that are used to collect information about weather and which one was their favorite to use. (2 minutes)
