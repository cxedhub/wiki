title: Exploring Potential and Kinetic Energy by Using Hot Wheels and Micro:bits
description: Students will be exploring potential and kinetic energy (how mass and velocity changes KE, when does an object have the most/least potential). They will have cars of different masses, with microbits attached, and a ramp to complete their trials. Afterwards, students will upload data, make graphs of the data, and interpret how different variables affected potential and kinetic energy.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be exploring potential and kinetic energy (how mass and velocity changes KE, when does an object have the most/least potential). They will have cars of different masses, with microbits attached, and a ramp to complete their trials. Afterwards, students will upload data, make graphs of the data, and interpret how different variables affected potential and kinetic energy.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. At which point is potential energy greatest?
2. What kind of energy is stored energy?
3. The faster an object moves, the ________ kinetic energy it has.
4. What kind of energy is in a moving skateboard?
5. What kind of energy is in a rock at the edge of a cliff?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students will be able to manipulate mass and velocity to change an object's kinetic energy
2. Students will be able to upload, analyze, and interpret data from the microbit
