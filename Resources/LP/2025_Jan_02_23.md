# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will pretend they are in charge of cybersecurity for a app. Their job it to retain users and increase the security of the system.  They will do this by working through the NOVA lab on Cybersecurity.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1.        What is Cybersecurity?
2.        What can you do to keep your information safe?
3.        How do you spot phony emails/spam?
## OBJECTIVES
Identify a strong password.
Identify a type of cyber attack.
Identify the different between a White Hat hacker and a Black Hat Hacker.


## CATCH/HOOK
Show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opRMrEfAIiI&t=7s and ask what would they do if they were asked the same question by a stranger or even their friends.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will pretend they are in charge of cybersecurity for a app. Their job it to retain users and increase the security of the system.  They will do this by working through the NOVA lab on Cybersecurity.
