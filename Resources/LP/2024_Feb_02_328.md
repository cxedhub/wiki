# Lesson Plan
## Overview
We are going to start by introducing the WonderBots to the children. I will introduce them to the program and the IPad that they will be using to code the robot. Then we will start with the very first program which will be turning on the lights and progress to drawing pictures on paper. This lesson will be broken up over more than one day.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do you tell a computer what to do? How do you think you can make the IPad tell the robot how to move? What do you think you will need to do to make the robot complete the task you want it to complete?
## OBJECTIVES
Can the student select the correct code buttons to turn on the lights. Can the student make their robot dance. Can the student draw a picture with their robot.


## CATCH/HOOK
We get to make these robots do what we want them to do by coding.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I will be following the 'Learning to Code Curriculum Guide' in the Wonder Workshop Guide for Kindergarten
Day 1: First I will be having Caleb our resident computer science expert and robotics coach come in as a guest. He will go over how to use the I-Pad and what coding is and how he uses it in his every day life. We will go step by step and show the students how to move the coding blocks into a sequence with a start block three lights blocks (yellow, red, then green) last we will show them how to end the sequence with the race animation. The students will then be able to see if they did the sequence correctly by pushing start. We will then discuss how to add to the code. We will talk about different lights and animations that they would like to add. We will also talk about how the blocks told the robot what to do. After the students master the first sequence we will move on to a new sequence that will have lights in a pattern and making the robot move (dance). We will discuss how to make new light patterns with the program and how to make the light pattern longer. 
Day 2: We will create a code to make a rainbow. We will also add to our code to make the robot make sound. We will discus how we could change things to make the robot show the rainbow twice. We will also talk about where we could put the sound block and what they think will happen. Once this is mastered we are going to introduce the face options in the menu. Each student will get to make a face with their code and explore different ways to move the code around to make the robot make different faces as well as different sounds. 
As the students learn to code we will continue to build on their skills for the rest of the school year.

## REVIEW
Each lesson will be wrapped up with discussions on how to make their code different. We will discuss what went well and what didn't and how we can make changes so that our robots do what they need to.
