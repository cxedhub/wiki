# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use arrows on a piece of graph paper to give directions to their classmates. They will guide their friends around the room without bumping into desks etc, from a certain point to an end point.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can the student identify the problem to be solved?
Can the student or group work to create a written program to follow to solve the problem?
Can the student or group debug their solutions?
3rd -5th Can the student or group create multiple programs for the same problem and decide when to use each one?
## OBJECTIVES
Work together with a partner or small group and cooperatively guide each other as programmers
Follow the directions as a robot would
Work together to debug and correct their programs


## CATCH/HOOK
K-2 Little Red Riding Hood needs to get the goodies to grandmas house. There are probably different ways to do this, different paths to take. We need to get the soup to grandma while it is still warm and tasty. 


3-5 Your new I-phone or game system,  was just manufactured, how will it travel to arrive at your house? Does it need to cross rivers or oceans? How do things move across the world?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Present vocabulary for the day;  Algorithm, debugging, sequencing, Language


Present the Hook from above


Model how to use graph paper to program the robot, what do the arrows and other symbols on the paper mean,  


Students will be split into groups of 3 or 4. 


Students will have a few minutes to start discussing the ideas they have.


Time to write algorithms and direct each other as programmer, navigator, robot, etc.


debugging will probably occur naturally as they see their solutions working or meeting the obstacles


I plan to have this lesson take several days so they will be able to refine their solutions
