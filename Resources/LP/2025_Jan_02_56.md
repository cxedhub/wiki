# Lesson Plan
## Overview
THIS A DRAFT-Student will program a microbit that locate magnetic north, south, east and west. They will create coordinates to find objects. Conclusion-explain how does microbit correspond to the Earth magnetic pull.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
To be determined
## OBJECTIVES
program a microbit to find true north. 
students will problem solve to locate objects using their microbit.
students will create a map for others to find objects.


## CATCH/HOOK
Can you accurately determine Earthâ€™s magnetic north with a micro-processor?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
