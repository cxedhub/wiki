## OVERVIEW


### Activity Overview:  
Students will receive a demonstration and introduction to using a Mnemonic to help them understand and recall the areas of focus in Cybersecurity. Students will collaborate to create and record a visual production to demonstrate the Mnemonic device.


### Meta description
+ *Grade Level :* 6-8 
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science, Reading/Language Arts, Technology 
+ *Cybersecurity Concept:* 
   + Defense in Depth, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Think Like an Adversary, Keep it Simple
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Networks and The Internet
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Communicating About Computing
+ *Materials:* 
   + Website, Recording devices on student computer, scratch.org, swivel (teacher use for recording)
+ *Considerations:*
   + Extensions can be made to improve the finished products and display them at a STEM fair or school-wide event.


## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will receive a demonstration and introduction to using a Mnemonic to help them understand and recall the areas of focus in Cybersecurity. Students will collaborate to create and record a visual production to demonstrate the Mnemonic device.


### PRE/POST-TEST
How can you use a Mnemonic device to recall the Cybersecurity areas of focus?
What are ways that you can communicate to others the important concepts in Cybersecurity


### OBJECTIVES
use a Mnemonic device to recall the areas of focus in Cybersecurity.
create a presentation to demonstrate to others the Mnemonic device.
create or debug a code to inform others of the Cybersecurity areas of focus.


### CATCH/HOOK
Have students brainstorm and share a few examples of Mnemonic devices. Then have them create a Mnemonic to illustrate a topic. Allow 1-2 students to share.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Discuss what Cybersecurity is and tell students that today they will learn a Mnemonic to help them recall and understand the different areas of focus in Cybersecurity. Demonstrate and model the Mnemonic for the Six areas of focus (Hand Mnemonic for Integrity, Confidentiality, Think Like an Adversary, Keep it Simple, Availability, and Depth). Allow students to partner up to practice, demonstrate with each other. Then call on individual partnerships to share with the whole group. Inform students that these products will be refined on another day and used in a schoolwide event later in the school year. Monitor students to determine if more practice is needed. Explain to students that they will now create an infomercial to share their learning with others outside the class. Give students options to record a pantomime, a poster, a Bingo card using pix cues, or a Scratch code (Public Service Announcement)






### REVIEW
Using predesigned sentence strips with an example of each area of focus (ex. "Make sure you don't use your birthdate as your password" = Think like an adversary), read or have students select a sentence strip and choose/show the finger most associated with the area of focus.


### STANDARDS        
ELA.7.C.5.1 Integrate diverse digital media to build cohesion in oral or written tasks.
FL


SC.68.CS-CC.1.2        Apply productivity and or multimedia tools for local and global group collaboration.
SC.68.CS-CC.1.3        Design, develop, and publish a collaborative digital product using a variety of digital tools and media-rich resources that demonstrate and communicate concepts to inform, persuade, and/or entertain.
SC.68.CS-CS.1.4        Interact with content-specific models and simulations to support learning, research and problem solving (e.g., immigration, international trade, invasive species).
