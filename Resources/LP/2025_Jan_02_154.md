# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Create a Venn Diagram using Google Slides. The activity can be used for Dr. Seuss' birthday and incorporates moving Red Fish, Blue Fish, One Fish, Two Fish to visually show and create a Venn diagram. Students Copy and Paste fish to show their difference and relations in numbers and colors on a Venn diagram.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
*How did you use Google Slides to create a Venn Diagram?


*What does the Venn diagram show about the numbers and types of fish?


*What other practical uses could a Venn diagram have to show information and data?
## OBJECTIVES
*Use Google Slides to show a computational, visual artifact.


*Learn how to create and use a Venn diagram using Dr. Seuss' Red Fish, Blue Fish, One Fish, Two Fish characters.


## CATCH/HOOK
Build a Venn diagram using Dr. Seuss' One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
On each slide you will find fish of different colors, sizes, and numbers. You will also find bubbles for grouping the fish.
On some slides the bubbles will have descriptions. Drag the fish into the bubbles that describe them. If a fish fits in more than one bubble, put it where the bubbles overlap.
On other slides, the fish will already be sorted in the bubbles. On those slides you need to figure out the rules for each bubble and type the descriptions in the boxes.
Finally, there are blank slides where you can make new sorting puzzles. You can copy and paste the extra fish, or add your own images (click 'Insert', then 'Image', then 'Search').
