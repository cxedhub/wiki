# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This will be the end of this mini unit, students will present to their classmates the nursery rhyme that they have coded on the microbits. While students present their nursery rhyme, they will show the code working in real time. The microbits should caption the nursery rhyme.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are terms used for logic loops?
What is an algorithm?
What is the use of a loop?
What does a 'for' loop do?
What does an 'if' loop do?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to write an outline of their code.
Students will be able to find iterations in a nursery rhyme.
Students will be able to identify simplifications in their code.


## CATCH/HOOK
After listening to your classmates presentation, think about nursery rhymes you are familiar with.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will present their microbit, read the nursery rhyme, and present the code.
