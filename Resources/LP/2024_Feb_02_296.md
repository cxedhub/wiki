# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Hardware/Software Sorting Activity:
For this exploration, you and your partner will sort the computer science resource cards into different categories.  This will provide opportunities for you to consider things like whether the resource is hardware or software, what type of hardware it is (input, processing, output, storage), and the purpose of the resource, compatibility, etc.).  You will have a better understanding of the differences between hardware and software after this activity.
## Meta description
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science 
+ *Grade Level :* K-2, 3-5 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Computing Systems, Networks and The Internet
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Collaborating Around Computing, Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems, Communicating About Computing
+ *Materials:* 
   + Hardware/Software Sorting Cards; Exit Ticket
+ *Considerations:*
   + *This lesson is already naturally differentiated, since older students most likely have more experience than younger students, so they will use more sorting cards.  Students who have used more resources will pull more cards for them to consider in their sorts.
*For younger grades, just give them the cards that they have experience with to begin the activity.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Hardware/Software Sorting Activity:
For this exploration, you and your partner will sort the computer science resource cards into different categories.  This will provide opportunities for you to consider things like whether the resource is hardware or software, what type of hardware it is (input, processing, output, storage), and the purpose of the resource, compatibility, etc.).  You will have a better understanding of the differences between hardware and software after this activity.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
*What is hardware?
*What is software?
*How do you know if you have the right hardware for the job?
*How do you know if you have the right software for the job?
*How do you troubleshoot problems with hardware and software?
## OBJECTIVES
*Differentiate between hardware and software.
*Determine best resources to use for a given task.
*Classify/Categorize the hardware and software resources.


## CATCH/HOOK
Take a tour of the SmartLab. Review (but donâ€™t identify as hardware or software) resources from the SmartLab used in previous years.  Reveal new resources to be used this year.  Tell students they will be thinking about all these resources as they complete the challenge for today.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
*Complete the hook and give a set of sorting cards to each pair of students.
*Have students fill out the first half of the exit ticket individually to see what they know.
*Have students pull out all of the sorting cards that match the previously used resources and the ones they will use this year (the sorting challenge will be naturally more details as students increase in grade level).
*Have students do the following sorts (with brief discussion following each):
--Divide the cards into two groups (hardware and software).
--Rearrange the cards into two new groups (familiar and unfamiliar).
--Sort the cards into new categories based on the purpose of the resources (bigger discussion for this one).
--Sort the cards into two new groups (resources you can troubleshoot independently and resources you need help to troubleshoot..
--Add any other sorts that you think of along the way!

## REVIEW
Have students work with their partner to fill out the second section of the exit ticket with any new or improved knowledge that they may have acquired during the sorts/discussions.
