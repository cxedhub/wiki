# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson provides an introduction to micro|bits and 4 levels of activities to learn about the possibilities of the micro|bit.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is computer science? Where are have you seen computer science in your world?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will learn the basics of a micro:bit
Students will apply learn at least 3 functions of a micro:bit.
Students will apply what they have learned on the micro:bit to create an original project using at least 2 actions from the micro:bit.


## CATCH/HOOK
Level up! Choose your own micro:bit adventure!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson provides 4 levels along with learning support to learn the variety of ways to code and use the micro:bit. Each level has a choice of activities for students to choose varying in interest and learning level.
