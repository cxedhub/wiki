# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Understanding Coding| How students use an algorithm in an unplugged lesson. Students maneuver an object from start to end, using direction cards.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm?
## OBJECTIVES
Work in small collaborative groups to create an algorithm, as they move their objects from start to finish.


## CATCH/HOOK
Watch a video about computer science algorithms.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Lesson Procedures:
1.        Discuss directions. What they are, why we use them, how we use them, what they mean, etc.
2.        Whole group: Show direction cards. Use direction cards to have all students help move my gnome from ‘start’ to his house.
3.        Table groups: Table groups use direction cards to move the gnome from ‘start’ into his home. Students are given 5-10 minutes to create their directions using the cards. Then each group will test their directions to see if they accomplished their task. Have students move to a new table and repeat 2-3 times, as time allows.
4.        Whole group: Discuss which groups were successful. Why or why not?
5.        Table groups discuss and share one thing they learned today.
