# Lesson Plan
## Overview
START HERE :get excited about weather!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How does recording the daily temperature over time help us in our daily lives ?
## OBJECTIVES
Read and record daily temperatures while looking for patterns in the weather as indicated by the micro:bit


## CATCH/HOOK
Use your 5 senses to describe weather


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Using a micro:bit, students will read and record daily temperatures. Based on inquiry students can explore how this information helps us in our daily lives.
Extension activities with the moisture indicator and plants can be observed to see how temperatures and moisture levels are related.  Furthermore, by using  Arduinos and Raspberry Pi’s to set up a weather station, allows for an all encompassing indication of weather that students can interact with and expand upon.

## REVIEW
I believe starting off with a working model of a micro:bit and having students recording  daily temps is a measurable activity and reviewable by conferencing with the students about what their recordings indicate about Weather.
