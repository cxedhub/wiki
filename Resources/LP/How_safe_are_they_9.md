## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Each group will be provided a different scenario regarding cyber security. After analyzing the scenario, they will need to explain the dangers presented, potential pitfalls, or things they would need to be concerned about as well as what ways they can implement more security measures.


### PRE/POST-TEST
What kinds of dangers to people need to be aware of when they are using digital tools? What things help you to know that a website is secure, accurate, and helps to maintain the integrity of the message?


### OBJECTIVES
think like an adversary and trouble shoot more effective ways to maintain cyber security.


### CATCH/HOOK
Each scenario are things they can visualize and are connected to things that are familar to most of them.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Scenario 1-


Carmen decided to order a pizza from Sal’s Pizza. Carmen opened up Google, typed in the name, and then clicked on the first thing that popped up. On the page that popped up was the name Sal’s Pizza. Carmen then proceeded to entire her entire address, credit card, and date of birth information. 
Scenario 2-


Brian and Mike created a tik tok video of a new dance they had been practicing. While filming the video in their 3DE shirts, there was a bystander who was making inappropriate gestures. They did not notice and still posted the video. 




Scenario 3-


Colby and Victoria were working on filling out information to apply to work for a Summer Camp. The camp runs through the sumer and will end a week before school starts. The website had pictures of kids kayaking, playing basketball, and camping underneath the beautiful mountainside. They were both excited to hopefully get hired to work at this local camp. 








Scenario 4-
While going through his email, Coach Axon noticed an email stating he had won a special reward from Stewart’s. Upon opening the email, a page popped up asking for his social security number, and mailing address to receive the reward by mail.






### REVIEW
Discussion of things to look for to determine whether a website is safe, as well as reminders of pitfalls to avoid. Additionally, I will ask them to reflect on what things they need to be thinking about as students, as they begin to apply for jobs and colleges, since most of them utilize technology to research information on candidates.
