## Lesson Plan
### Overview
For the Nature of Science students are practicing going through steps in scientific inquiry.  Students need to understand that scientist research, analyze, systems to test the integrity of a system. Students will use the scientific method to analyze the  integrity, confidentiality and the depth of defense   of a social media platform


### PRE/POST-TEST
Why is confidentiality important?  How can you insure the integrity of a message you send to someone else? What is one way you can protect yourself on social media?  What is an adversary and why should you care about how they think when being online?


### OBJECTIVES
1.        evaluate a mode of communication to analyze  it confidentiality, depth of defense, and integrity. 
2.        Plan and carry out scientific investigation, make predictions, identify variables, collect and organize data
3.        Design and conduct a study 
4.        Describe and/or analyze common methods and/or models used in different fields of study
5.        Explain how hypotheses are valuable if they lead to further investigations
6.        Understand that scientific investigations involve the use of logical reasoning, explanations, and models to make sense of the collected evidence.


### CATCH/HOOK
Starter: 5- minutes This is an upgraded form of telephone where one student passes a message to another student by a whisper.  First person start off with a message to read, given by teacher. Whisper to second person. Every third student writes down what was said the fourth person reads it to themselves and whisper is to the next person.  Continue until the last person writes a message.  By the end of the message students will then share the final message.  Students will look figure when the message got changed.  On the Board write a thinking map of the problems they have with text messages as well as problems it may cause.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
A.        Teacher will Do:  20 minutes: tell students that today they will practice Scientific Inquiry and research how different platforms are useful but have disadvantages as well. Review digital safety as described in your state benchmarks. Review the Hand Concepts:  Defense in Depth,  Integrity, Think Like and Adversary, Confidentiality. 
B.        Guided Practice Students will Do: 30 minutes, If possible, have students work with in pairs to brainstorm together. Students will select one form of communication platform (twitter, snapchat, Whats App, Telegram, Tic-tox, personal emails) and use the scientific inquiry process to answer the following prompts


Write a problem they see with how the platform allows them to communicate with others and Potential problems and how it is affecting them or others. (Examples might be, predators, private information shared, bullying, getting the wrong message)
Research the concern they have, and research see what articles might have to say about it.
Data: What are the Numbers? What does research say about the amount of time students are communicating on their social platforms? How does time spent on social platforms affect students?
Write a Conclusions on their findings.
C. Whole Class: 20 minutes students will share their findings with the group
Wrap up: Review hand concepts (confidentiality, Integrity, Think like an Adversary) with students.
