# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The students will create a path for the coding critter to follow using arrow cards and then inputting the directions into the coding critter using the arrow buttons on the critter. After inputting the information, the student will start the critter and watch it move through the programed path.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can we get the coding critter from the start line to the finish line?
How did you get the coding critter to move along the path from start line to the finish line?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to create a path for the critter using arrow cards.
Students will be able to input the path information into the critter using the arrow buttons on the back of the critter.
Students will be able to start the critter and watch as it follows the path created by the student.


## CATCH/HOOK
Showing the students the coding critter and the maze, telling them that they will get to program the critter.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
In a small group of two or three students, have the coding critter in the middle of the table. I will have a path set up for the critter to maneuver through. I will first self-talk my way through creating an algorithm to get the critter through the maze. I will first use the arrow cards to lay out a path for the critter to follow ex: two straight arrows, one left turn arrow, three straight arrows, one right turn arrow, two straight arrows. I then press the path or code matching arrow buttons on the back of the critter, I then press start and watch as the critter makes it's way through the path. Next, I guide the students through the maze, letting them lay out the arrow cards and program the critter. One student presses start and they watch to see if they programed the critter correctly to move the critter through the maze. Then I will let the students each take a turn programming the critter to make it's way through the path.

## REVIEW
Ask the question 'So, what steps did we have to take to get the critter through the path to the finish line without going off the path?'
