title: Nature Art| Merging Nature, Algorithms, and Programming in an inclusive environment
description: This lesson is an introduction to computational thinking and the BBC micro|bit. Students learn how to create nature abstractions by observing nature,, using art materials and then using the LEDs on micro|bit.
They'll develop an understanding of several key computational thinking concepts, including logical reasoning, abstraction, algorithms and evaluation.
Students then develop their programming and debugging skills and are introduced to working with outputs.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is an introduction to computational thinking and the BBC micro|bit. Students learn how to create nature abstractions by observing nature,, using art materials and then using the LEDs on micro|bit.
They'll develop an understanding of several key computational thinking concepts, including logical reasoning, abstraction, algorithms and evaluation.
Students then develop their programming and debugging skills and are introduced to working with outputs.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
I also did this lesson differently.  Our art program was dramatically cut.  In my past two lessons, the amount of girls was incredibly low.  I wanted to be creative to offer some CS experience to girls.  I have a lot of girls who come into my library.  I have many art supplies out for them to use and they do, all the time!  So I wanted to use my relationship with them and their love of art to get a micro:bit in their hands.  I also wanted to do it on their time frame with no assignment required-therefore I did not do any formal pre and post questions.
## OBJECTIVES
STUDENTS
can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation
can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems
can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies, analytically to solve problems
are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology

## REVIEW
The wrap up is the hardest part.  I have not successfully had any of the microbits I loaned back.  I knew this might happen.  For me, it was a risk I was willing to take.  At least I got microbits in the hands of girls.  Every one of them swears they are going to bring it back, but no success so far!
