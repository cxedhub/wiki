# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Directions for Coding- unplugged
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can I create a list of directions to move from my table to the classroom door?
## OBJECTIVES
use manipulatives to create directions to the classroom door.


## CATCH/HOOK
I need to move from my desk to the classroom door.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Lesson Procedures:
1.        Discuss directions. What they are, why we use them, how we use them, what they mean, etc.
2.        Whole group: Show direction cards. Use direction cards to have all students help move me from the back of the room to the sink.
3.        Table groups: Table groups use direction cards to move from their tables to the door. Students are given 15 minutes to create their directions using the cards. Then each group will test their directions to see it they accomplished their task.
4.        Whole group: Discuss which groups were successful. Why or why not?
5.        Explain how students will use directions to program their blue bots to move and complete tasks through the school year. 
6.        Table groups discuss and share one thing they learned today.
7.        Clean up materials and return to supply bins.
