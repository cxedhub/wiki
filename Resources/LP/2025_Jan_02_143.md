title: PE Cryptic Decoding
description: Students will be divided into groups/teams of 3-4. Once they are divided up, each group will be sent out to start at a different station in the gym (every station will have one chromebook and one microbit waiting.) The group's job will be to decode the message that plays across the microbit. It should start out as looking like gibberish, but the students should work through and troubleshoot to find out which way, and by how many characters the alphabet is being moved. Once they have figured out the details, they will decode the entire message, and then perform the task that is being asked of them (ex. Each group member does 50 jump ropes, or each group member must make a free throw… etc.). Once they have decoded the message and performed the task, they can move to a different location in the gym that will have a different microbit, different chromebook, different code to decipher, and a different task to complete. This will continue until all stations are completed.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be divided into groups/teams of 3-4. Once they are divided up, each group will be sent out to start at a different station in the gym (every station will have one chromebook and one microbit waiting.) The group's job will be to decode the message that plays across the microbit. It should start out as looking like gibberish, but the students should work through and troubleshoot to find out which way, and by how many characters the alphabet is being moved. Once they have figured out the details, they will decode the entire message, and then perform the task that is being asked of them (ex. Each group member does 50 jump ropes, or each group member must make a free throw… etc.). Once they have decoded the message and performed the task, they can move to a different location in the gym that will have a different microbit, different chromebook, different code to decipher, and a different task to complete. This will continue until all stations are completed.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the Ceasar code and how do you decipher it?
How can microbits assist in completing physical activities?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will decode and solve cryptic coded messages on mircobits (Ceasar Code).
Students will work to solve in small groups/teams.
Students will participate in physical activity exercises (once the code is found from the microbit).


## CATCH/HOOK
Students should be excited to be using unused technology and tools that we have never used before in the physical activity setting.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be divided into groups/teams of 3-4. Once they are divided up, each group will be sent out to start at a different station in the gym (every station will have one chromebook and one microbit waiting.) The group's job will be to decode the message that plays across the microbit. It should start out as looking like gibberish, but the students should work through and troubleshoot to find out which way, and by how many characters the alphabet is being moved. Once they have figured out the details, they will decode the entire message, and then perform the task that is being asked of them (ex. Each group member does 50 jump ropes, or each group member must make a free throw… etc.). Once they have decoded the message and performed the task, they can move to a different location in the gym that will have a different microbit, different chromebook, different code to decipher, and a different task to complete. This will continue until all stations are completed.

## REVIEW
The students, when finished, should have performed all the asked physical activities (all participating) while working and collaborating well together through the process.
