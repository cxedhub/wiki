# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students use GIS online software to analyze local watersheds and draw conclusions about earth changes over time and connect local areas to a larger region.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a GIS system?
What can GIS be used for in everyday life?
Approximately how large is our local watershed?
How does a watershed change the surface of Earth over time?
## OBJECTIVES
Use ArcGIS to analyze data and draw conclusions.
Connect ArcGIS data to personal experiences to make meaningful connections
Use local GIS data to ask questions about the change of Earth’s surface overtime


## CATCH/HOOK
Let them explore Esri map viewer and have them generate questions about Earth's surface.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Follow the steps in this link. This is a good place for getting started with GIS. Students should work on this worksheet as they work through the steps listed on the initial PDF. This student worksheet was made to be place specific, it can be edited to students’ hometown.
