# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson continues with the next section of  Mystery Science: Grade 3 Water Cycle & Phases of Matter: Local Weather Patterns & Weather Predication.  Following Stormy Skies, Part One, this listen will go into more details about clouds.  Students will learn about different types of clouds, wind direction, and how to prepare for a change in weather by looking at patterns.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Ask students to define or draw a picture with each of these words: 
cumulus
cumulonimbus
stratus
stratonimbus


Have students write or draw the answer to this question: How are clouds formed?
## OBJECTIVES
identify clouds that they see outside or in pictures they are shown.


## CATCH/HOOK
Make cloud dough with the class  https://babbledabbledo.com/how-to-make-cloud-dough/  Discuss with students is what an actual cloud is made of.
(Can prep before on to have cloud dough avaiable to touch and see and lead into a discussion)


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson can be broken up to use for 20-30 minute time frame over 5 days or in one setting.  It can can be adapted to your schedule.
(Day 1) 
Background knowledge: Read Stories  To incorporate in reading class, have a center with a variety of books that discuss weather, storms, clouds, etc.  Suggested books both fiction and non-fiction:  National Geographic for Kids: Weather, National Geographic for Kids: Clouds; National Geographic: Storms; The Meteorologist In Me; and Saving Eli's Library. Option to read one storm to the class.
Introduce the lesson by discussing the first lesson about the clouds they saw in the video and even outside.  Review the data collection weather section and show there is a place for type of cloud.  Ask students what this section could be.  Make a list of ideas.
(Day 2)
Beginning the video portion of the lesson.  Mystery Science: Grade 3 Stormy Skies Local Weather Patterns & Weather Predication   
Follow the lesson with directions in the videos.  Three videos to play with discussion questions.
Vocabulary used for students to know and apply to the lesson: 
Cumulus
Cumulonimbus
Stratus
Stratonimbus
Meteorologist


(Day 3-4)
Experiment in Mystery Science (7 steps; follow directions with Mystery Science)  Make sure all materials needed by Mystery Science are prepped.
(Day 4-5)
Wrap up with the final part of Mystery Science
