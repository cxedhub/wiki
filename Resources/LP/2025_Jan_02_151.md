# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The students will analyze three different websites. During their exploration the students will answer three questions. The students will determine what the website is sharing, why is it important to them, and if the information is reliable? Students will collaboratively work together to try to answer the three questions.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are websites?
What are the purpose of websites?
How do you know if a website is reliable?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will analyze websites to determine:
- what the website sharing?
- why is the information important?
- is the information reliable?


## CATCH/HOOK
I will show a picture of person exploring the Internet. I will ask the students to describe the importance of the Internet. The students will share their thoughts with a partner.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The students will participate in the pre-test. The students will participate in the warm-up: 
by answering the following questions: 
1. If  you could say something important to the whole world, what would it be? 
2. Why is it important to you?
Students will get a sheet of paper to write their answers. The students will explore three different websites and answer three questions. Students will determine three different aspects of the website:
1. What is the website sharing?
2. Why is it important to them?
3. Is the information reliable?
The students will collaboratively work in pairs to answer the questions. Students will take the post-test.
