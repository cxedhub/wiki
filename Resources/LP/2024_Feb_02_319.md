# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be introduced to block coding using the website makecode.org. They will code a virtual microbit by completing a tutorial of making a heart.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the name of the 2 basic starting blocks used?
What is a simulator?
What will the simulator do with the On Start block?
What will the simulator do with the Forever block?
What if the code doesn't work?
## OBJECTIVES
1-Students can get on to Makecode.org.
2-Students can use block code to follow the assigned tutorial.
3-Students will complete the tutorials and then explore on their own.


## CATCH/HOOK
I showed the students a physical Microbit programmed to say Hello and explained that they would be programing their own virtual Microbit.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I started off with showing the students a programmed Microbit that said Hello. 
Students were asked the pre test questions. Next the students took out their iPads and followed directions to get to makecode.org. They selected Microbit, then the first tutorial to make a heart. The next step they needed to select which option to code. Since these students are new to coding they selected Blocks. The students followed the tutorial to make a heart and to also add a new 'Show LED' and make their own design. When students were done they showed their virtual Microbit to their neighbors. At the end the students answered the Post test whole group.
