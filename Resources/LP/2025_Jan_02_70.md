# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson students are reminded about the ever growing uses of technology devices within the healthcare profession, and how technology addresses many of the largest health issues we face. Students will brainstorm and program a device to address a real-world healthcare problem, of their choice.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. In what ways is Computer Sciences used in the healthcare system?
2. What are some devices used within the healthcare system that we can program using a micro:bit?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will understand the use to technology in the world healthcare system
Students will develop and understand the importance of prototyping
Students will use the algorithm to write, test and debug a working Micro:bit program


## CATCH/HOOK
Computer Sciences in Healthcare is inevitable, daily, our healthcare is changing as we once knew it. In this activity I want to challenge you to learn how to program current pieces of technology our healthcare providers already use! (Video: https://youtu.be/G1IsZeFR_Rk)
