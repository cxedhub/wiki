# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is an introductory lesson that I used with my 5th & 6th grade students. This lesson introduces students to basic programming on a microbit. Students will then use this basics course to create games using microbits.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How did your program include variables to store and modify data?  What program did you create to included sequences, events, loops and conditionals?
## OBJECTIVES
I can create a program that use variable to store and modify data. I can create programs that include sequences, events, loops and conditionals individually.


## CATCH/HOOK
We will watch a video on Micropets.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will learn to use basic coding to create programs using microbits.

## REVIEW
Students will share their microbits and present what their microbit does.
