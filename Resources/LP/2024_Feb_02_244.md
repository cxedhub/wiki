# Lesson Plan
## Overview
5th grade students will mentor kindergarten students in how to properly care for and navigate their personal computer. To begin, they will outline the key vocabulary of computer parts and how to keep their computers clean and safe. Next, they will help kindergarteners to locate the Internet and login to Clever. Finally, they will help kindergarteners login to specific apps within Clever. Each task will be assessed by a 5th grader to ensure that the kindergartener has successfully mastered the task and can repeat the task independently.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Did you successfully teach a kindergartener the computer parts (screen, keyboard, mouse pad, charging port) and how to turn on your computer? 


Did you successfully teach a kindergartener teach a kindergartener how to login using your student ID badge?


Did you successfully a kindergartener to describe and locate the Internet icon on the computer? 


Did you successfully a kindergartener to locate the bookmarks and the Clever icon within the bookmarks?


Did you successfully a kindergartener to locate the Splash Learn icon within the CLEVER database?


Did you successfully a kindergartener how to login to the Splash learn app using the classroom passcode and picture icon?
## OBJECTIVES
I can successfully teach a kindergartener how to login to their computer. I can successfully teach a kindergartener to locate the Internet icon and find the Clever app. I can successfully teach a kindergartener to navigate the apps in Clever.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will facilitate a discussion about learning a new technology (phone app, game, Google slides). We will discuss if the task came easy or if challenges were present at first. After that 'Think back to when you were just learning how to use your school email or even just logging into a new app you used in school. Sometimes this can be challenging. Now consider, the kindergartners across the hall. This is the first year that they have worked with a computer that is assigned just to them. This is also the first time they have had to login to a computer using an ID badge, which can be tricky at first. Our job today will be to help guide the kindergarteners to navigate their computers independently. Can you do that?


 (This discussion will be with 5th grade only, the Kindergarten hook will be different)


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson will be taught the first week of school.


Introduce the lesson after the hook has been established.


'Your job today will be to help guide the kindergarteners to use their computers on their own. There are several tasks within this job. You will need to do your best to guide the learning, not taking over and doing everything yourself. If we always do the work for someone else, we are taking away from their learning'


Task 1:
- What are the parts of the computer (screen, keyboard, mouse pad, charging port)
- How to turn on the computer
- How to use your ID badge to login to your computer


After 5th graders guide kindergarteners to accomplish Task 1, the computer will be shut down and 5th grader will assess kindergartener on how well the task can be completed on their own. This is also an assessment to see how well the 5th grader provided instructions. Reteach as needed


Task 2:
- How to find and explain what the internet icon looks like
- How to use the mouse pad to click on the Internet icon
- How to find and describe the CLEVER icon
- How to open CLEVER
- How to locate the QR code box and click so the camera comes on
- How to use ID to login to CLEVER
- How to click 'allow' if the camera is blocked


After 5th graders guide kindergarteners to accomplish Task 2, the computer will be shut down and 5th grader will assess kindergartener on how well the task can be completed on their own. This is also an assessment to see how well the 5th grader provided instructions. Reteach as needed


Task 3:
-How to locate the Splash Learn icon 
- How to open Splash Learn
- How to type the class code and find the picture password
- How to find their own avatar
- How to navigate between the 'abc' games and '123'games


After 5th graders guide kindergarteners to accomplish Task 3, the computer will be shut down and 5th grader will assess kindergartener on how well the task can be completed on their own. This is also an assessment to see how well the 5th grader provided instructions. Reteach as needed

## REVIEW
Go through the checklist to determine if all tasks in each group were mastered.


Whole discussion - what went well, what do you need more practice with?
