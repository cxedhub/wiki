title: Robotics for Students in the Functional Life Skills (FLS) Program
description: As the library exists to offer an inclusive space for everyone, this lesson is geared toward giving students with complex needs in a Functional Life Skills (FLS) class the opportunity to explore coding and robotics. Students will read an ebook about robots and 3-D shapes. Then they will build models and discuss uses for robots. Then they use coding and robotic tools such as an Osmo coding apparatus on their iPad to code a virtual robot or a Sphero and its accompanying coding app. Students shall also have the opportunity to build robots from kits and present their projects.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
As the library exists to offer an inclusive space for everyone, this lesson is geared toward giving students with complex needs in a Functional Life Skills (FLS) class the opportunity to explore coding and robotics. Students will read an ebook about robots and 3-D shapes. Then they will build models and discuss uses for robots. Then they use coding and robotic tools such as an Osmo coding apparatus on their iPad to code a virtual robot or a Sphero and its accompanying coding app. Students shall also have the opportunity to build robots from kits and present their projects.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can we use code to program a robot?


How do robots help us?
## OBJECTIVES
Students shall be able to code a virtual robot or an actual robot.


Students shall create a robotics artifact, using the tools and materials provided, through employing the design cycle.


## CATCH/HOOK
The teacher shall begin by demonstrating to students the Osmo Coding Awbie or by driving a Sphero through a set of obstacles, assuring them all the while that they too will be able to program a robot and even build their own robot.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Let students know that they will be investigating Robots: building robots, coding robots, programming robots, and using virtual robots


Discuss with students what a robot is and what it does.


Introduce vocabulary (coding, programming, virtual, 3-Dimensional Shapes: cube, cone, cylinder, rectangular prism, etc.)


Read: Robots: 3-D Shapes by Joseph Otterman on epic!


Start designing and building simple robots with blocks, going over shapes.


Complete “Problem Solving” assessment - Robots, p. 20 & Math talk p. 25.


Introduce students to Osmo - Coding Awbie.


Allow students opportunity to explore Awbie on Osmo along with other Osmo apps.


Introduce students to Sphero and its app.


Allow students opportunity to explore Sphero and its coding capabilities.


Allow students opportunity to build robot kits, focusing on shapes.


Discuss with students ways robots help us.


Discuss with students their ideas for the future of robots.


Have students present their robots and projects.


Instruct students to complete the Reflection Form - forthcoming.
