# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Use the micro|bit to create a kinesthetic model of the solar system. Students will be given an example at the beginning and then be asked to make their own.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a scale?
What type of code allows a sensor to continually sense and record data?
If the sun was the size of a baseball on [teacher]â€™s desk, where would Neptune be?
## OBJECTIVES
program a micro:bit to alert them when they have walked the correct distance to create a scale model of the solar system.


determine how adjusting the ratio of the model sun to the real sun changes the ratio of all other objects in the solar system model.


develop an accurate, scale model of the solar system using physical computing, coding, and math.


## CATCH/HOOK
Create a scale model using a quarter and a dime to show students the size difference and distance of Earth and Mars.

## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Using the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxPdbOC1Tys, have students create a basic code to show the model that has been created. Students then improve upon this to develop their own.

## REVIEW
Present the video. Talk through how many planets are in the current model and what the limitations are. Have students identify limitations of the first model
