# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will program a Micro|bit and as a species counter, and to log the data that is collected. Then they will analyze the data collected and work to identify factors that may affect the data - eg time of day, time of year, weather conditions.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the most prevalent bird species in Douglas during the month of ___________.
What factors affect observation of birds in the area?
## OBJECTIVES
Program the Micro:bit to collect data.
Access the data stored on the device.
Analyze the data and make inferences that can be supported by the data collected.


## CATCH/HOOK
Play the song of the Yellow Warbler, a common bird near the school.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
See attached document for detailed activity plans.

## REVIEW
Students will share their data to a shared spreadsheet where the class will work in groups to note larger trends, as well as similarities and differences.
