title: Real World Cyber Security in the Present
description: Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand. This is the third of a three lesson unit offering 5th graders an opportunity to seek out present day cyber attacks and present their findings to the classmates. The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Social Studies, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security. This lesson will need one additional day for students to finalize PowerPoint presentations, and another day to present their work.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand. This is the third of a three lesson unit offering 5th graders an opportunity to seek out present day cyber attacks and present their findings to the classmates. The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Social Studies, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security. This lesson will need one additional day for students to finalize PowerPoint presentations, and another day to present their work.
## Meta description
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science, Social Studies, Reading/Language Arts, Technology 
+ *Grade Level :* 3-5 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Networks and The Internet, Impacts of Computing
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems
+ *Materials:* 
   + Web availability to search 'Top 10 Cyber Attacks'
+ *Considerations:*
   + Some students might have trouble getting information in ten minute timeframe.  This is a good point to differentiate the focus to either let students continue on with a single event, or have students practice the skill of getting as much as possible in given timeframe knowing that they might not get finished.  The latter option really emphasizes that students need to steer clear of 'wormholes' and crack down on the task at hand.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand. This is the third of a three lesson unit offering 5th graders an opportunity to seek out present day cyber attacks and present their findings to the classmates. The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Social Studies, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security. This lesson will need one additional day for students to finalize PowerPoint presentations, and another day to present their work.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are some recent cyber attacks that happened around the world?
## OBJECTIVES
1.  Students will accurately use reliable sources to research three cyber attacks within the last five years. 


2.  Students will create a multimedia presentation that address the following:
                  A.  A quick summary of the event with factual text evidence (at least 3 facts)
                  B.  Identifying which production, distribution, and consumption category that was 
                       affected in terms of needs, wants, goods, and services. 
                  C. Describe with 100% accuracy how the areas of health, economy, and/or 
                       environment were impacted by this cyber attack.


## CATCH/HOOK
Will we ever be fully protected from cyber attacks?  How, or why not?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
5 min Think/Pair/Share what was remembered about the Maroochy-Shire Water 
Treatment Cyber Attack.  Introduce the daily focus of researching three recent cyber attacks that have taken place anywhere in the world in the last five years.   They’ll start by working individually jotting cyber attacks they know about on their white boards.  .


        8 min  Write/Pair/Share cyber attack stories students have heard of.  Students pair and 
share for three (one minute) sessions, growing their own lists from peer sharing.  Students then partner up and Google search “Top 10 Cyber Attacks in the World,” to find if they have any matches on their whiteboards.  Students then open up “Cyber Security” Google slides they created from the previous two lessons and add a slide listing three cyber attacks they want to research with their partner.


8 min  Student teams collaborate via Google Slides and create three slides to describe 
each cyber attack they’ve chosen.  Each slide needs two panels; one for each  student to type their noted findings from research.  Use remainder of ten minutes to begin researching and noting cyber attack choice #1.


        8 min Student teams research and note cyber attack choice #2.


        8 min Student teams research and note cyber attack choice #3


        8 min Wrap up 
Project a few student volunteers’ working drafts on a classroom large screen to share findings with the whole class.. 
 After a few students have quickly shown their work, tie lesson to;
1. The impacts their chosen events had on the economy, health, and environment.
2.  Did the company that was attacked fulfill a need, want, good, and/or service.  
3. What was learned through the lens of how we may have averted this attack. 
4.  How we know we used reliable sources for our research.


 Close lesson with explaining to students that they will spend one more day to finish up research and polishing up slide presentations; being sure to have information that includes the attacks’ impacts. And the next day presenting our Google Slides to the class.
