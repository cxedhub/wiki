Geography Standard 1: How to use maps and other geographic representations, geospatial technologies, and spatial thinking to understand and communicate information
The student is able to:
A. Identify and describe the properties (position and orientation, symbols, scale, perspective, coordinate systems) and functions of geographic representations, as exemplified by being able to identify and describe the properties of a variety of maps and globes (e.g., title, legend, cardinal and intermediate directions, scale, sym­bols, grid, principal parallels, meridians) and purposes (wayfinding, reference, thematic).
B. Construct maps and graphs to display geospatial data, as exemplified by being able to construct a map that displays geospatial data using symbols ex­plained in a key (e.g., a sketch map to illustrate a narrative story, a map of cars in the school parking lot showing type and color, a class­room map showing different types of tables, desks, and chairs). |

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Adapted from| Flocabulary.com 7/2020 “Become a Map-Maker and Explorer” Use this lesson plan to commemorate Magellan’s arrival at the Pacific Ocean in November of 1520. Students will practice key geography vocabulary and learn about Magellan’s contributions.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How does Magellan’s choice of technology compare to those we use today to explore and travel?
How does Magellan’s choice of technology contrast to those we use today to explore and travel?
## OBJECTIVES
Define key geography vocabulary related to map skills, oceans and landforms;
Create a map tracing Magellan’s route to the Pacific Ocean;
Write a paragraph from Magellan’s point of view about his journey using geography vocabulary;
Compare/contrast the technology used then (in the time of Magellan) vs. the present.


## CATCH/HOOK
His fleet sailed from Spain across the Atlantic and down the east coast of South America. In Magellan’s time, the Atlantic Ocean was called “the Ocean Sea.” Magellan began to look for a way to get around the southern tip of South America. In October 1520, he finally discovered a strait, or a narrow body of water that connects two larger bodies of water.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
“Become a Map-Maker and Explorer”
Use this lesson plan to commemorate Magellan’s arrival at the Pacific Ocean in November of 1520. Students will practice key geography vocabulary and learn about Magellan’s contributions. They’ll create a map tracing his route to the Pacific and use the vocabulary they learn to write a paragraph from Magellan’s point of view, describing his journey. They’ll compare and contrast the technology Magellan used vs. explorational/navigational technology of today.  Students will then make maps of a location at school and use classmates’ maps to navigate.

## REVIEW
Create a map of the U.S. and show how Lewis and Clark traveled across the country, and share the technology they used to navigate and explore.  How do these tools compare and contrast to Magellan's?
