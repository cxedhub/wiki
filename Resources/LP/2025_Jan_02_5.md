# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use peer collaboration, engineering, problem solving, & reflection, when given a set of Funny Gears & Bricks, to design an amusement park.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you write a detailed algorithm describing your amusement park?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will collaborate respectfully together, to accomplish the task of building a gear amusement park that turns, then write an algorithm describing their formation, trade algorithms with another group, test the algorithms, then reflect upon their work.


## CATCH/HOOK
Help!  These bears and monkeys are SOOOOO bored!  Work together with your group to create an amusement park for them to ride.  BUT make sure you pay close attention, because you’ll need to record your steps as you write a detailed algorithm so another group can follow your directions to make the exact same amusement park you did.  Good luck!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Purposefully design groups, pass out materials, and demonstrate how to place a few bricks/gears together to build students’ background understanding.  Talk through the algorithm template so they know which picture goes where and how to make sure it’s detailed enough to trade with another group.  Let students get to work!  Walk around and monitor progress.  Guide work and answer questions as needed.

## REVIEW
Have the groups come back together and discuss today's work together as a class.  Begin with a turn & talk, then share out with everyone.  This will help give students a good review, ideas, and vocabulary to use when completing their reflection.
