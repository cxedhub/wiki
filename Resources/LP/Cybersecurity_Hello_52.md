## Lesson Plan
### Overview
The lesson is an overview of the 6 pillars of cybersecurity using the hand model as a mnemonic device.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Question 1: What does Confidentiality mean?
Question 2: What does KISS stand for?
Question 3: What is a cipher?


### OBJECTIVES
Identify the 6 parts of the hand model
Vocabulary: adversary, confidentiality, Integrity, availability, defense


### CATCH/HOOK
Have a hand waving on the smartboard. Each student will have a blank piece of paper and told to trace their hands.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
[10 minutes] A hand will be waving on the smart board. The class opening will be about the hand - 5 digits and the palm. The students will trace their individual hand {right or left} on a blank sheet of copy paper. 


[4 minutes] Video about Cybersecurity


[5 minutes] Pre-test on Google form from questions above


[30 minutes}] The teacher will discuss CyberSecurity : what it is, how does it affect the world, where it occurs, when does it affect the student
The teacher will discuss each of the 6 pillars and have the student fill in the hand as each pillar is discussed.  
          GenCyber 6-Concept AKA "The Hand"
Index Finger - Confidentiality (shh!!)
Ring Finger - Integrity
Thumb - Availability (Thumbs up / Good to go!)
Middle - Think Like an Adversary
Pinky - Keep it Simple
Palm - Defense in Depth


To connect all of the 6 pillars use this demonstration:
* Blow up a glove
* Tie off at the open end
* Have the class vote on the strongest pillar
* POP that pillar (a pen or scissors)
** Repeat**
*Do another glove but this time pop the weakest pillar


[10 minutes] Class discussion on how all of the parts work "in hand" with each other.
Let the students share any thoughts they have on the matter.


[5 minutes] Post-test Same questions as above


[Enrichment time]Take up the hands to post on the wall outside the classroom.  NO NAMES on the display side of the paper - only on the back. Allow the students to decorate or color the hands if possible.






### REVIEW
Balloon popping is always fun - it drives home the concept of how all the parts work together.
