# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson, students explore the methods of writing pseudocode to complex problems.  Writing pseudocode is a great way to understand the design of algorithms and how the initial algorithm will be set up.  The focus of this language is on human reading rather than machine reading so many students will find this as a great tool to use before actually developing an algorithm through a programming language.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is pseudocode and how is it used in the design of algorithms? 
How is pseudocode different/similar to flowcharting?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to write pseudocode in the problem solving of algorithms.
Students will be able to use indentation to show dependency's within an algorithm.


## CATCH/HOOK
PB&J Algorithm
Materials Needed:
1. Peanut Butter
2. Jelly
3. Bread
4. Butter Knifes 
5.  Paper Towel


Start by having the students write out the steps needed to properly create a PB&J sandwich.   While they are doing this, begin to setup the materials above in preparation of creating the PB&J sandwich.   Once the students have finished writing their instructions begin by having them read you their individualized instructions. It is important that you follow them exactly as they state them.  The point of this lesson is to show that computers only can follow actuate instructions.  For example: If a student told me to spread the peanut butter on the bread without telling to remove the lid first.  Then I would try to playfully jab the knife into the container.  This is one of many ways to gather their attention for this lesson.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
After completing the catch above.  Open up the presentation below follow the slides with describing how pseudocode can be used to help develop the initial structure of algorithms.   The presentation will show students how pseudocode is written out in unison of the blocky programming language.  The biggest point of emphasis with this is showing how indentation is used to show dependency's within an algorithm.
