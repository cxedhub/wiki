# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this unplugged activity students will learn different ways to write out programs/codes to create large scale pixel art pieces. Students will learn three different ways to program/code through out class practiced activities. End project will include a large scale art piece created out of a binary code that students individually created and another student has to decode.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm? 
What is a program?
What are binary codes?
What is decompose?
## OBJECTIVES
Objective #1: Teach students what a binary is and how that correlates to computer memory. 
After the class learns different ways to code and decode a message, the teacher will explain binary and its correlation to circuits and computer memory.


Objective #2: Students will create a binary code to be decode be another student.
Students will create pixel art based off of another students Binary code.


## CATCH/HOOK
Between storing data and opening people up to the world through social media, computers have become a vital part of our daily lives.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Lesson being modified PIXEL CODING 3 Ways (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNtIWWemewcpFLUbT0erQFr6ps5UfZgr/view?usp=sharing) Stepping point for assignment and work sheets are easy to understand. 
Further step by step directions need to be added to achieve end project of larger scale project


Separate the kids into 3 groups.
Give each group one part of the encoded message.
Give the kids around 10 minutes to solve the code.
Repeat with each different types of Code (Program your Painter, Write your own Binary Code and ASCII Code Alphabet)
Have each group share out what they did to solve the code. 
Consider: What worked best? Did one group solve the problem in a way you didn’t think about? What would you do differently? 
Reference the Rise model.
Explain to the students that they just acted like a computer at the most basic level, translating bits to actions and tasks and vice versa to be displayed on a computer screen.


Creating you own Code
NEED MORE STEPS HERE


You as the printer


Have each student create a grid on a piece of square paper
Grid squares should be a minimum of 1”x1” 
Grid should be a minimum of 7x7
Using the Binary code you decoded to correctly paint grid squares
Write reflection

## REVIEW
Objective #1: Teach students what a binary is and how that correlates to computer memory. 
After the class learns different ways to code and decode a message, the teacher will explain binary and its correlation to circuits and computer memory.


Objective #2: Students will create a binary code to be decode be another student.
Students will create pixel art based off of another students Binary code.
