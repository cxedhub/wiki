# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be using their school-provided technology (whether it be an IPad or a Chromebook) and being walked through how to use a school-safe search engine. Once we have all gotten the devices powered on and the search engine open, we will all be looking for age-appropriate walkthrough videos that will be walking the students through different physical activities of their own choosing. Each student will find a video that they like, present them to me, and when they have all made their choices, I will cast them one at a time, and each student will participate in all videos for the class activity.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you power on your device?
Can you open a school safe search engine?
Can you find a school appropriate video?
Can you participate in the video steps?
## OBJECTIVES
Power on their device and open a search engine.
Use their search engine to find educationally appropriate physical activity videos.
Participate in physical activity exercises (once the appropriate video is found).


## CATCH/HOOK
Finding a fun, school appropriate physical activity walkthrough video and sharing it with the class, then doing the fun activity.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be using their school-provided technology (whether it be an IPad or a Chromebook) and being walked through how to use a school-safe search engine. Once we have all gotten the devices powered on and the search engine open, we will all be looking for age-appropriate walkthrough videos that will be walking the students through different physical activities of their own choosing. Each student will find a video that they like, present them to me, and when they have all made their choices, I will cast them one at a time, and each student will participate in all videos for the class activity.
