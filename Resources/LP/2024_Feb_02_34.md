# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Introduce your students to shared document norms while practicing identifying main idea and key details.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. How can you show respect for other's work in a shared document?


2. What are two rules you think are the most important when using a shared document with your peers? 
2a. Why do you think those are the most important rules?


3. What rule would you add to help students use a shared document to complete a written assignment together?
## OBJECTIVES
Follow a set of rules to collaboratively work on a shared document where all student work is respected to complete a document written by multiple students.


## CATCH/HOOK
Have a paper plane contest. Use the groups that you foresee working together in the same document. Each small group gets three sheets of blank copy paper to create a paper plane to fly in a class competition. They can make up to three planes but only one gets to enter the contest. Whichever groups plane flies the farthest could be the winner or you could listen for how teams work together and respect each other to determine a winner. After the contest have students start thinking about what worked in their groups and what didn't. How might we work together in groups so that everyone contributes, is respected, and the product represents a collaboration?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will practice using a collaborative document to work as a class on main idea and key details.

## REVIEW
Continue to address the norms each time students will work on a shared document.
