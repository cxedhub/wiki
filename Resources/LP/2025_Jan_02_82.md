# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this unplugged activity students will learn different ways to write out programs/codes to create large scale pixel art pieces. Students will learn three different ways to program/code through out class practiced activities. End project will include a large scale art piece created out of a binary code that students individually created and another student has to decode.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is an algorithm? 
What is a program? 
What are binary codes? 
What is decompose?
## OBJECTIVES
Objective #1: Teach students what a binary is and how that correlates to computer memory. After the class learns different ways to code and decode a message, the teacher will explain binary and its correlation to circuits and computer memory.


Objective #2: Students will create a binary code to be decode be another student. Students will create pixel art based off of another students Binary code.


## CATCH/HOOK
Lets play Mario! Students will have a friendly game of old school Mario Cart to see what pixel art looks like.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pixel Coding 3 Way:
Separate the kids into 3 groups.
Give each group one part of the encoded message.
Give the kids around 10 minutes to solve the code.
Repeat with each different types of Code (Program your Painter, Write your own Binary Code and ASCII Code Alphabet)
Have each group share out what they did to solve the code. 
Consider: What worked best? Did one group solve the problem in a way you didn’t think about? What would you do differently? 
Reference the Rise model.
Explain to the students that they just acted like a computer at the most basic level, translating bits to actions and tasks and vice versa to be displayed on a computer screen.


Creating you own Code:
Taking what you have learned, students will know create a code that makes a large size “pixel” picture
Students will create  a code that fits a minimum 7x7 grid, with a minimum of two colors.
They may use any of the codes taught in class.


You as the printer:
Have each student create a grid on a piece of square paper. 
Grid squares should be a minimum of 1”x1”  (Image should be at least 7” x7”)
Grid should be a minimum of 7x7
Trade codes with another student in class.
Decipher your code
Paint each grid square to reflect your code
Sign name on back and turn in.
Have each student share what they did to solve the code and how they felt their final piece turned out.. 
Consider: What worked best? Was it easier to  solve the problem by yourself or when you worked with others. Did the painting turn out like the original coder wanted. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?  What would you do differently? 
Reference the Rise model.
Explain to the students that they once again acted  like a computer at the most basic level, translating bits to actions and tasks, similarly to how a computer would send data to a printer to create an image.

## REVIEW
Explain to the students that they once again acted  like a computer at the most basic level, translating bits to actions and tasks, similarly to how a computer would send data to a printer to create an image. 


Review with students the vocabulary words ( algorithm, program, binary codes and decompose)
