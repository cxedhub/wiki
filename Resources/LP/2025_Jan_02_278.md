# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Get ready to battle your CuteBot car!  Develop code for your Microbit using loops, variables, and conditionals to outsmart the other Cutebots to be the last bot standing or be the first to take out the threat!  Using your design thinking skills to think outside the box to build a battle shell for your cutebot to withstand all challengers in the Lancer Arena!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What makes a structure durable?
2. What are nesting, conditionals, variables, and controls?
3.How can I debug my code?


See attachment for activity; https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5da8692a3aa9c4001cc0e333?source=quiz_page
## OBJECTIVES
1. Create a solution for their armor 
2. Develop code
3.Evaluate their design


## CATCH/HOOK
For this unit, I will show a video from Battlebots to build momentum,  spark creativity, and get the wheels turning for code development.  I will teach like a pirate and be mimicing the announcers voice using my speaker system as kids enter my room.

## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will apply their knowledge about conditionals, loops, variables, and controls for the microbit.  Cutebot cars will be used with the Microbit.  Students will have to construct a shell to transform their device into a Battlebot and present their solution during a bot challenge.  This lesson will be broken down into 8 days, every other day for 50 minutes.  They will have already been using the Microbit and this will serve as the culminating activity for the unit.
Day 1: Students will watch the Battlebot videos, take the pretest quizizz and then will code the first three cutebot activities (lights, turns, and sensors).  Students will learn/practice variables, conditionals, and controls in these coding activities.  
Day 2:  Students will complete the Cutebot coding activities 4 &5 exploring tracks, nesting, and loops with continued variables.  Students will utilize their time by exploring alternative code as they think about how they will navigate their Cutebot for the upcoming challenge
Day3: Students will develop a design plan for their challenge including bot shell plans and coding plans.  We will review the rubric and the challenge rules.
Day 4: Students will code their solution and test on the devices, refine, and retest.  Potential refine of the bot shell to accommodate the coding.
Day 5: Students will construct the bot shell and test. 
Day 6: Students will finish up constructing the bot shell and making any last minute code changes/debugging.
Day 7:  Bot Challenges!
Day 8: Finish Bot Challenges and do the pair deck and evaluation activity.
