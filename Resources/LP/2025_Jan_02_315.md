# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Create a magic trick you can perform to impress your friends. When you move the sticky labels on your micro|bit’s A and B button, you appear to make the buttons really switch over.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre-Test Questions:  
How can a magnet influence the way the compass function operates on your microbit?
Can you write different expressions and, when evaluated, get the same result?  


Post-Test Questions:
Which operations produced the same result?  
What were some of the obstacles you faced when trying to recreate/prove your answer or solution with the microbits?  
Did the sticky labels on your microbit really make the buttons switch over?
## OBJECTIVES
Students gain practical experience of writing computer programs to solve problems.
Students evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies analytically to solve problems
Students will be responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology.


## CATCH/HOOK
Ready to make your microbit do magic?  This is magic trick you can perform to amaze your friends! When you move the sticky labels on your micro:bit’s A and B button, you appear to make the buttons really switch over


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The student will need their micro:bit and any magnet that is small enough to fit in their hand, such as a fridge magnet.  The micro:bit’s compass will need to detect the magnet. A compass will tell which direction it is pointing to by detecting the Earth’s magnetic field, but it can also detect any other magnet nearby. This will be used that to check if the magnet is next to the micro:bit by using the magnetic force block on the editor.  Then, the student will  program the micro:bit and practice the trick.

## REVIEW
This activity would be utilized at other times throughout the year to review how the compass function works on the microbit.
