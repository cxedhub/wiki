# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will explore probability and coding by coding the Micro|bit to generate random responses similar to flipping a coin.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How many times will you probably need to flip a coin to have it land on heads 6 times?
## OBJECTIVES
Program the Micro:bit to generate random artifacts.
Explain the idea nd meaning of probability.
Determine the probability for a specified result given a set of parameters.


## CATCH/HOOK
The first coins found were in modern-day Turkey.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be given a finite number of times to 'flip' a coin virtually and record the results.


Students will use a spreaadsheet and chart to analyze the results.


Students will form hypotheses regarding the probability of specified outcomes.

## REVIEW
Can you better predict an outcome with more or fewer events?
