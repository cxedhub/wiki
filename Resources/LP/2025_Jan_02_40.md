# Lesson Plan
## Overview
A good introductory lesson for students to learn how to start coding in Scratch. This lesson uses Scratch to teach students how to program use iteration and create unique designs.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you move your shape into the four different coordinate planes?
How were you able to overlay your shapes?
Create a simple algorithm in Scratch.
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to:
Use a coordinate system to place elements on the screen.
Sequence code correctly to overlay shapes.
Create a simple algorithm in Scratch.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students are exposed to examples of different images of art created by a computer program as they wait for class to start.
