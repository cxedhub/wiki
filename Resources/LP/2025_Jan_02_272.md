# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is for more advanced students wanting to code a Python program that uses nested loops. This is not block coding. They will use their own IDE to write the program. I have attached a photo of a sample program that they can write.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a nested loop? Why would we need a nested loop?
## OBJECTIVES
explain what a nested loop is and demonstrate how they can be used in a program.

## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Vocabulary: nested loop, inner loop, outer loop


Key ideas: 
Nested loops never overlap. Ann inner loop is always completely contained within an outer loop. 


An inner loop goes through all of its iterations each time as the outer loop goes through just one. 


The total number of iterations executed by a nested loop is the number of inner loop iterations times the number of outer loop iterations. 


Write the program. Allow students to follow along or give it a go on their own. Debug together as a class as problems arise.

## REVIEW
Play 2 truths and a lie. Which 2 are true? 
When one loop is nested inside another, the loop that contains the other loop is called the outer loop. 


You need to create nested loops when the values of two or more variables repeat to produce every combination of values. 


The number of times a loop executes always depends on a constant.
