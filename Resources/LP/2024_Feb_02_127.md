# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students research a field of science that interests them and the technologies that are used to solve-problems in that field. Questions students should answer are: what are the technologies and how do they work? How have the technologies evolved over time. Students then should recreate one of the technologies with a micro:bit; they may use a previously created project or create a new one. They must also reflect on this question: what's one way you would improve or enhance the technology?

+ *Grade Level :* K-2, 3-5, 6-8 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Computing Systems, Data Analysis, Impacts of Computing
+ *Computer Science Principles:*

+ *Materials:* 
   + Website, Micro:bit
+ *Considerations:*
   + Know the prior knowledge students have. Allow different groups of students to research different levels (example: an older student might understand a complex laser used by an optometrist while a younger student might talk about a simple weather measuring station). Let the students explore what interests them and encourage deeper/more critical thought when necessary.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students research a field of science that interests them and the technologies that are used to solve-problems in that field. Questions students should answer are: what are the technologies and how do they work? How have the technologies evolved over time. Students then should recreate one of the technologies with a micro:bit; they may use a previously created project or create a new one. They must also reflect on this question: what's one way you would improve or enhance the technology?
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are some of the technologies used in your chosen field? How do they work and what do they achieve for the scientists? How could you enhance the technology or make it better than it already is?
## OBJECTIVES
SWBAT:
*identify technologies within their chosen scientific field.
*explain what the technology does and how it does it (in simple terms).
*create the technology with a micro:bit project file.


## CATCH/HOOK
Make a radio collar micro:bit to show the students an example of a real scientific technology recreated with the bits.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The class begins with discussing different fields of science that interest the students (this is also done out loud so students can see who they may want to pair up with). The majority of the instruction time will be for students to explore their science fields and the technologies, recreate one with a micro:bit project, and prepare to present their findings to the class (or small groups).

## REVIEW
As a class, we'll discuss some of the technologies our classmates discovered and recreated. What was their purpose? Could they be improved?
