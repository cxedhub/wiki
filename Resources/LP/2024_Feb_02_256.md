# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The students will use Micro:bit blocks to create the image of snow when shaken.  This will be done with sequences, repetition, planning, and debugging.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Which are the coding blocks that would always be used in animating a micro:bit?
What are other animation ideas that you could try in the future?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Become familiar with sequences of code, using the 'pause' and 'duplicating' functions.
2. Use 'repeats' and 'loops' to simplify animation sequences
3. Create 'variables' to help keep track of values


## CATCH/HOOK
Wyoming winter is coming!  Let's create some snow on our micro:bits that can help us get excited for some colder weather!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Step 1:  Using 'show leds' create the basic shape of the globe
Step 2:  Place the trigger button 'on shake' into to sequence
Step 3:  Turn the LEDs on and off by adding a 'plot x 0 and 0' block. Experiment with other plots to see where the lights show up.
Step 4: Now try the 'unplot' with the same coordinates
Step 5.  Notice the program is working, but moving quickly.  Place 'pause' blocks in your sequence.
Step 6.  Use the 'Function' command to simplify your steps in the 'Advanced' category
call it 'snowflake1'
Step 7. Drag your 'plot-pause-unplot'  into your new function plot.  
Step 8.  Make more functions by right clicking your snowflake 1 function and 'duplicate' it.
Notice the new numbers' snowflake2, snowflake3
Step 9:  Now change the coordinates in each new function.
Step 10:  Finally, place all your new functions inside the 'on shake' block.

## REVIEW
Download your program onto your micro:bit.  Check to see if it works and troubleshoot if needed.  If time, make more snow.
