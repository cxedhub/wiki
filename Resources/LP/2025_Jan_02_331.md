# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will play Conways Game of Life after studying microbial behavior. Students will use The game of life to Describe bacterial colony behavior and the dependency on resources available.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Describe Equilibrium.
How do resources effect bacterial growth?
How do resources effect human growth?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to describe the relationship between resources and colony growth. 
Students will be able to describe growth and decay relationships.
Students will be able to identify, and describe equilibrium/ steady states.


## CATCH/HOOK
Show the game of life on the board and allow students time to play around with the resource.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
-Engage/ Hook 5 min - Students will start class by playing around with the Game of Life resource. Getting a feel for the engine. 
-Explore/ Communicate 10 minutes - Students will be provided with the rules of the Game of life and try specific patterns. 


-Communicate 5 min - Students will work with a partner to explain their findings.


-Empower 20 min- students will be given the opportunity to create their own steady state system that reaches equilibrium while continuing to move. Students can work with partners.

## REVIEW
-Launch- 10 min - Students will be given the pre and post test questions again and be given the opportunity to revise their thinking with examples
