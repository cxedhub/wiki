# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The teacher will introduce the topic of cybersecurity by asking students about any personal experience they have had with the topic. The teacher will display the cybersecurity slideshow and tell the students that they are each going to have their own slide in this slideshow to complete. Their topic will be randomly chosen, it will be a subtopic of cybersecurity. When all of the slides are complete, a presentation of the slideshow will be shown to the entire class.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is meant by the term 'cybersecurity'?' 'What are different types of cybersecurity issues?' 'What can you do at home and at school when you are online in order to protect yourself from different cybersecurity issues?'
## OBJECTIVES
discuss with classmates/the teacher the meaning of cybersecurity in grade-level terms, elaborate on a subtopic of cybersecurity (via the slideshow), and describe ways they can keep themselves safe in an online community (via the slideshow).


## CATCH/HOOK
Personal information can and will be stolen from you or someone you know in the future.' 'I'm sure that some of you may know someone who had their personal information stolen or shared on the internet when they did not want it to be.' (Many students will probably want to share stories.)
