# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This is a project for students to experience the differences between analog and digital waves. Students will be comparing and contrasting the particulars of these waves, as well as coding a radio game to use digital waves.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
List between 3-5 advantages AND disadvantages of analog signals. 
List between 3-5 advantages AND disadvantages of digital signals. 
When would it be best to use analog signals over digital signals?
When would it be best to use digital signals over analog signals?
How has the use of digital signals impacted your everyday activities?
How has the impact of digital signals (like the hot potato game) changed the social aspect of class, or school in general? Is it possible to have the use of these signals make a positive impact on our school culture? What about a negative impact?
## OBJECTIVES
Model analog waves. 
Model digital waves. 
Compare and contrast digital and analog waves. 
Code a game that uses digital waves.


## CATCH/HOOK
Do you call friends on your cell phone, send them text messages or send emails at school? All of those forms of communication are messages that are sent and delivered by signals, which are wave pulses.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This is a project with 6 activities where students explore differences between analog and digital signals, culminating in a coding activity for a hot potato game and a discussion about the use of digital waves in society.
