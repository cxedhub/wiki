# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is used to introduce microbits to students. Students will be able to code with inclusion of sequences, events, loops, conditionals, and variables.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How did your program include variables, sequences, events, loops and conditionals
## OBJECTIVES
5.AP.C. 01 Using grade-appropriate content and complexity, create programs that include sequences, events, loops, and conditionals, both individually and collaboratively.
5.AP.V.01 Using grade-appropriate content and complexity, create programs that use variables to store and modify data.


## CATCH/HOOK
Watch a video on micropets


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will go to microbit.com and we will begin to learn about the coding aspects using the makecode software. Students will trash the forever block and make sure the simulator is off before beginning to explore. 
•        Students will insert a show LED block, from the basics list, into the on start block and have students make a shape in the show led block. 
•        Students will predict what they think will happen once the run the code. Students will run their code. 
•        Students will turn off the simulator and change the show led to show string block, from the basics list, and have them type their first name in the string. Students will predict and run the program. 
•        Students will compare the 2 blocks. 
•        We will then trash the program and select on button pressed, on logo, and on shake from the input list. 
•        We will insert a show icon block into the on button A, a show string in the on logo block, and show icon (change picture) in the on shake block. We will predict and run the program. 
•        We will create a time variable to change emotions based on how long between inputs.
•        Students will notice nothing happens unless you press the button, the logo or shake the microbit.
•        Students can then investigate different blocks and controls for the rest of the time.
•        Once students have investigated the online simulator we will attach our microbit and download their code.  They will notice that there is an error on their microbit and their code will not run.  Due to the fact these are not the newest version of Microbits, they cannot use sound or the logo button.
•        Students will then create emotions that change on the microbit as they push buttons, tilt, turn upside down, etc. Students will then modify their code and make emotions for their microbit. They will need to create 7 different emotions using the various inputs on their microbit.
•        Students will share their programs with each other in small groups.  They will then journal about their microbit experience.

## REVIEW
Students will then learn to add to their sequences conditionals and loops by choosing a game to create from the microbit menu and then modifying the code to make it their own.
