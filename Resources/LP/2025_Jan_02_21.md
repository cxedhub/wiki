title: What is Coding
description: This lesson is meant to introduce what coding is to a younger age group. Students will learn what it means to program or code something that a computer will be able to follow. The assignments are done both digitally or hands on. This will help build a foundation of how to block code and what coding is.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson is meant to introduce what coding is to a younger age group. Students will learn what it means to program or code something that a computer will be able to follow. The assignments are done both digitally or hands on. This will help build a foundation of how to block code and what coding is.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is coding?


Programming a computer means you…


To debug means you…
## OBJECTIVES
know what coding means
understand that algorithms are step by step instructions
make and follow a code that is given to them.


## CATCH/HOOK
How do you think machines work? How do they know what they need to do?
Watch the video on what coding is


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
You will introduce what it means to program a computer to follow a set of instruction. What kinds of computers there are around us that use programs to complete tasks. Then students will practice following codes or step by step instructions. After that they will use either hands on or digital activities to work on making their own set of codes to have a partner follow.
