# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson introduces Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to students. We explore ways in which GIS impacts our communities and our world as well as ways in which it solves problems and affects decision making. Students will understand domain-specific GIS vocabulary and use ArcGIS software to create a web map that answers a research question.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is GIS? 
What is a Geographic Information System?
How does GIS impact our world?
How can GIS be used to solve problems?
How can GIS affect decision making?


Within ArcGIS:
What is a layer?
What is a feature?
What is symbology?. 
(Not finished)
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to:
Describe Geographic Information Systems and how they impact our world
Define terminology used to make maps with ArcGIS 
Use ArcGIS software to create a web map that answers a research question
Write a reflection about the process and present findings


## CATCH/HOOK
Students take a walk around the perimeter of the school grounds and then work independently or with a partner to draw a mental map of the grounds and building. Students can volunteer to share their work and the group will participate in a gallery walk.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Hook: Walk outside, create a mental map of the school, participate in a gallery walk
Pre-test
Introduce objectives and answer questions
Show introductory video and present GIS introduction slides (direct instruction)
Present maps that change the world website and discuss impacts
Provide 10-15 minutes to explore ArcGIS, student gallery and/or ESRI newsletters
Discuss impacts, problem-solving and decision-making (note-taking optional)
Guided tour of  ArcGIS including layers, features, symbols etc. with a printed guide with definitions
Lead students through a geoinquiry about American Indian lands in the United States
Analyze the American Indian lands map and identify map elements in small groups
Discuss the research question from the geoinquiry and make observations
Students analyze base maps and layers and develop research questions 
Students create a web map designed to answer their research question(s)
Present maps
Take post-test
Write a reflection
