## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will participate in a discussion post regarding confidentiality on Canvas. “What do you think confidentiality means in terms of cybersecurity, what is one example of a breach in confidentiality and what solutions can you provide to address your issue? (Response must be a minimum of 100 words). In this lesson students will go through several data displays through direct instructions. Students will utilize a gradual release model referred to as TATER (Title, Axis, Trend, Explanation, & Relationship) to interpret and analyze their data tables/ diagrams. Students will complete 4 – 5 data display independently. Students use their programmed Micro: bits to participate in a series of multiple-choice questions regarding data tables/ diagrams. Students will collaborate with one another and clarify any misconceptions during whole group. The element of confidentiality will be a crucial element in this portion of the lesson as students will establish a foundation of security and privacy.


### PRE/POST-TEST
Pre-assessment & post-assessment on the concept of confidentiality regarding cyber security through Canvas. 


Discussion post: “What do you think confidentiality means in terms of cybersecurity, what is one example of a breach in confidentiality and what solutions can you provide to address your issue? 


Unit 1.1 Assessment is attached at the bottom of the lesson plan.


### OBJECTIVES
Increase in engagement
Increase in collaboration
Fostering a foundation of cyber security by using Micro: bits


### CATCH/HOOK
Using Micro: bits to foster engagement and cybersecurity


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
In this lesson students will go through several data displays through direct instructions. Students will utilize a gradual release model referred to as TATER (Title, Axis, Trend, Explanation, & Relationship) to interpret and analyze their data tables/ diagrams. Students will complete 4 – 5 data display independently. Students use their programmed Micro: bits to participate in a series of multiple-choice questions regarding data tables/ diagrams. Students will collaborate with one another and clarify any misconceptions during whole group. The element of confidentiality will be a crucial element in this portion of the lesson as students will establish a foundation of security and privacy.
