# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Kindergarten students will be working with 5th grade students to learn about the proper care and use of their computers. They will learn how to turn on their Chrome books and login using their badge. They will then be able to get into the internet and find clever in the bookmarks. Once in clever they will be able to navigate the apps provided. They will know how to login in to the app if necessary and how to find their avatar. Each task will be assessed by a 5th grader to ensure that the Kindergartener has successfully mastered the task and can repeat the task independently
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre Test: Can you name the parts of a computer and turn on the computer? Can you login using your student id badge? Can you describe what the internet icon on your computer looks like?  Can you locate the bookmarks and the clever icon within the bookmarks? Can you find the splash learn icon in clever? Can you successfully login to splash learn using the class code and picture password?
## OBJECTIVES
I can successfully login to my computer. I can successfully locate the internet icon and find the clever app using my mouse mouse pad. I can successfully navigate the apps in clever and login independently.


## CATCH/HOOK
Tell me about the things you do on your tablet or phone at home. (Discuss this before the classes get together for this activity)


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Kindergarten students will first listen and watch how the 5th grader does a task. They will then be asked by the 5th grader to do the task they were shown. 
Task 1
~Name the parts of the computer (screen, keyboard, mouse pad, charging port)
~How to turn on the computer
~How to login using their student ID badge
Task 2
~Find and describe the internet icon
~Use the mouse pad to click on the icon
~Find the bookmark bar

~Open the clever Icon
~ Find the QR code box and click this so that the camera can see the QR code on the student ID badge
~If the camera is blocked the student needs to be able to click allow so that the camera can be accessed. (Trouble Shooting)
Task 3
~Locate Splash Learn icon (Hippo)
~Open Splash Learn and enter the Class Code that will be written on the board all year
~Click the Picture password

## REVIEW
Go through the checklist to see if the kindergartener in each group was able to accomplish the tasks. Have a whole group discussion about what went well and what the students need more practice with.
