# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Part 1| Gauge student understanding of computer science and introduce basic CS vocabulary. 
Part 2| Teach students about SpeedGeeking, a collaborative and energetic sharing of computer science apps and tools. Students create computational artifacts and participate in a SpeedGeeking workshop.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
See Google Form attached to lesson for vocabulary questions.
SpeedGeeking: On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you about discussing technology?
What are your 5 favorite websites?
When was the last time you learned about a website that would allow you to change how you learn, or integrate computer science skills?
## OBJECTIVES
Define computer science terms and explain what computer science is
Evaluate and model the use of interest-based applications / software
Communicate about computing: Present/share choices while integrating domain-specific vocabulary


## CATCH/HOOK
Robots Activity
Two students stand shoulder to shoulder in front of the leader. They are the robots. To make them start or stop, the leader touches the top of their heads. Left shoulder tap = turn 90 degrees left and right shoulder tap = turn 90 degrees to the right.
Discuss directions, inputs and outputs and surprising variables and results.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Hook - Robot Activity
Explain objectives
Pre-assessments
Quizlet study
SpeedGeeking Intro Slideshow 
Model example with Tinkercad (if most students are unfamiliar with it)
Students create artifacts, integrate vocabulary, and sign up for SpeedGeeking session
Assign student roles
Conduct SpeedGeeking session
Review / Reflect
Share rubrics and take vocabulary post-test
Gather and/or discuss student feedback about how to improve the lesson

## REVIEW
Summative vocabulary test
Exit ticket with an explanation of computer science
Answer the SpeedGeeking questions from the beginning
Debrief after SpeedGeeking session
Poll to measure engagement, enthusiasm and learning
Rubrics for presenters
