title: Using Microbits to measure light level of sunlight for optimal plant growth
description: Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores the natural world using microprocessors.  They will study the phenomenon of photosynthesis. Students will create an experiment that uses Microbit light sensors to determine the optimal amount of sunlight needed to grow the fastest growing bean plant, from seed to germination. 
They will program a Microbit to accurately measure the amount of sunlight a plant receives.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will investigate and design an experiment that explores the natural world using microprocessors.  They will study the phenomenon of photosynthesis. Students will create an experiment that uses Microbit light sensors to determine the optimal amount of sunlight needed to grow the fastest growing bean plant, from seed to germination. 
They will program a Microbit to accurately measure the amount of sunlight a plant receives.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1)        How do you know a plant is growing? 
2)        Choose a plant and make a diagram showing what this plant needs in order to grow.  Label all parts of the plant that you know and explain each function. 
3)        Explain if a microprocessor, such as Microbit, can improve the growth rate of a plant.
## OBJECTIVES
Observe how different amounts of sunlight affect the growth of a plant.  
•        Draw their own conclusion from their experiment.
•        Gather evidence of inputs and outputs by finding the amount of sunlight a plant can absorb.


## CATCH/HOOK
In my lesson there are pictures of a Microbit + a seed + the sun = ________________. 
This Google form does not allow me to copy and paste the diagram.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS

## REVIEW
I would review my students misconceptions and make sure that they have been corrected.  By checking with students daily and having an exit or entrance ticket and conversations with them about their experiment.  Also, students will be given feedback in their final lab reports.
