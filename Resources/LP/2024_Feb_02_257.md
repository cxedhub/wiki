# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Turn your micro:bit into a music player. Code musical notes using simple commands. Listen to your program using earphones and crocodile clips and wish your friends or family a happy birthday!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can you use simple commands such as play, notes, and keys?
## OBJECTIVES
learn how to setup the micro:bit as a music player
learn how to code music on the micro:bit


## CATCH/HOOK
It's your friend's birthday.  Can you code a program that with wish them a happy birthday with music?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Let’s use music blocks to play sounds on our micro:bit.
1.         Start by adding the code that includes a single musical chord with e the ‘play’ block.  
2.        Insert the chord “C’.  
3.        Click ‘run’ to see if your code works.
4.        Now keep adding musical chords with the ‘play block.’  Place the appropriate chord blocks, “D”,”F”, and “G” to finish the first part of the song.  Keep everything to a “1/4” beat.  
5.        Place a ‘pause’ block at the end of the first part with the value of “100”.
6.        Start the second part of the song, looking for the appropriate notes and pauses.  
7.        Click ‘run’ to see if the code works as expected.
8.        Once you’ve finished, connect your micro:bit using pins P0 and GND.  Connect using earphones or a speaker with crocodile or spring clips.
