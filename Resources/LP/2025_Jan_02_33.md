# Lesson Plan
## Overview
They are introduced to variables and develop their understanding through a mixture of unplugged and practical programming activities. Pupils design and program the micro|bit to be a star-jump and step counter and a family activity selector.


The sequence comprises 5 lessons of approximately 60 minutes each|


Describing with variables
Using variables in algorithms and programs
Analysing, programming and evaluating step-counters
Planning to get active
Programming and evaluating a family activity picker
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are variables?, How are variables used in programs?, How can I debug a program algorithm that uses varibles?
## OBJECTIVES
can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation
have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve problems 
can evaluate and apply information technology
are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology


## CATCH/HOOK
We are taking our creation on algorithms from Kodable to using Microbits, how will things be similar and how will things be different about the algorithm/programs that we create

## REVIEW
We will be doing this unit of 5 lessons over the next couple of months so there will not only be time for the lessons but time to independently explore how to best use the Micro-bits. So throughout the lesson we will review each week and then continue to build thorough the completion of the lessons
