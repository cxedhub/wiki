## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will locate, read and research articles from sources to better understand using  credible sources for research.


### PRE/POST-TEST
How can I determine if online sources are credible?
Why is it important to maintain integrity in online sources of information?


### OBJECTIVES
Students will locate reliable sources online.
Students will use resources to research and answer questions on a Social Studies topic.


### CATCH/HOOK
Pose the question: What are some sources or places that you use to conduct research. After sharing, students will play the telephone game to share a message privately to the person near them, with the object of seeing if the original message is intact when returned to the originator (teacher)


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Explain to students that the focus for the lesson is to learn about the concept of integrity in Cybersecurity by learning and using information from sites to complete research. Play the brief youtube video. Then have students share one point from the video (orally). Distribute the graphic organizer to research Landmark Supreme Court Cases. Students may choose to work alone or with a partner. Inform students that they will now search for sites that will help them to complete the chart (using the tips mentioned in the video). Monitor the students as they work, gving feedback and using questioning to help them achieve results.






### REVIEW
Using a 3-2-1 format, have students share 3 things that they learned from the lesson or research, 2 things that they found interesting and want to know more about, and 1 question about the information shared by another student.
