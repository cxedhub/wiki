title: E' is for Erosion
description: Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will have to come up with a plan to avoid the cybersecurity breech in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will have to come up with a plan to avoid the cybersecurity breech in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will learn the effects of wind and water erosion.  They will create their own landscape to show how water erosion works.  After the background knowledge has been built, the town of Rawlins has had a cybersecurity breech and they have released all of the water supply in Rawlins.  Students will have to come up with a plan to avoid the cybersecurity breech in the future and then determine the impact of the breech on the community.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is erosion and some examples of erosion?
What are some examples of a cybersecurity threat? 
How can you try to avoid a cybersecurity threat?
Give some examples of what could happen to a community with a major security breech?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students can explain and give examples of erosion. 
2. Students can explain what a cybersecurity threat it and how to help avoid it. 
3. Students can explain the impact of a security breech and how it could effect and entire community.
