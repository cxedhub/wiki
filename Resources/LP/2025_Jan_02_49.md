# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will create a micropet and then program it to perform various outcomes depending on what they do to it. Students will learn how to program a microbit. Students will recognize programming faults and be able to make corrections.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What changes did you need to make to your program?
## OBJECTIVES
Create a program for your microbit:
•        Pet must be able to show an emotion when you turn it upside down or right side up.
•        Pet must be able to make a noise when you shake it
•        Pet must be able to show a name when you push button A
•        Pet must show a picture when you push button B
•        Additional-Use an if/then code


## CATCH/HOOK
Do You want to build a Micro Pet?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will create a micropet which will perform various outputs depending on the input.
