# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this activity, students use the scientific inquiry process to investigate the effect of water on Earth materials. They explore how water flows through different materials and make a connection between permeability and flooding.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How do Earth materials affect the impact of flooding?
In the Introduction Story- Weather Worries, we learned that Suzi’s grandma does not live near a body of water. How can her local area experience a flash flood?
## OBJECTIVES
Use scientific reasoning to ask questions, make observations, and investigate ideas to acquire knowledge and solve problems.


## CATCH/HOOK
Show students sand, clay, topsoil, and pebbles. How do these materials relate to a flood?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Ask students what they think scientists do. Tell students that they are going to act as scientists as they test the amount of water that flows through different Earth materials.
Lead a discussion about scientists.
Why do you think scientists use the scientific inquiry process?
How do you think the scientific inquiry process helps scientists in their work?
Why is it important to ask questions as you work through the scientific inquiry process? Why do you think that? 


Steps of the scientific inquiry process
Ask:
Guide students to understand how the investigation will help them learn how different Earth materials affect flooding. Explain that the amount of precipitation and the specific Earth material affects flooding, and we want to investigate what that effect might be.
Share the testable question with the students:
How do different Earth materials allow water to pass through them?
Have students write down the testable question in their science journal or launch log.
Lead the discussion for students to consider how they could test this question.
Predict:
Show students the Earth materials available for testing. Guide students to predict which material will allow the most water to pass through and which materials will allow the least amount of water to pass through. Have students record their predictions. Then share out loud with the rest of the class.
Investigate:
Guide each group to test the permeability of the different Earth materials.
Place two graduated cylinders in the plastic drainage bins.
Place a funnel inside each graduated cylinder.
Add a cotton ball to cover the opening inside each funnel.
Use the paper cup to fill each funnel with one scoop of Earth material. Put a different material in each funnel.
Observe:
Use a different graduated cylinder to pour 50mL of water in each funnel.
Observe as the water drains through the Earth material.
Have students compare the amount of water in each graduated cylinder.
Guide students to record the amount of water in each graduated cylinder.
Explain:
Lead a discussion about what students observed during the investigation. Ask students to explain their thinking as they share their thoughts. Be sure to address any misconceptions.
                Which material allowed the most water to flow through or permeate? The sample that allowed the most water to flow through is the most permeable. Permeable soil helps reduce the amount of flooding.
                Which material allowed the least amount of water to permeate? What do you think the consequences are for less permeable materials?
                How do the results compare to your predictions?
                Why do you think these materials absorb different amounts of water?
