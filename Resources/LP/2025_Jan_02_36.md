## Meta description
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science, Library Media 
+ *Grade Level :* 6-8 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Networks and The Internet
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems
+ *Materials:* 
   + Website, Canvas LMS, Common Sense Media Digital Citizenship Curriculum (Google slides presentation & quiz)
+ *Considerations:*
   + I had to make some small adjustments to the slides, to make them flow better. I also added a section of 'phishing clues' that came from an optional handout, because it listed very specific clues of phishing techniques to look for within a message or pop-up ad. This lent itself very well toward preparing students for the quiz.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson helps students identify phishing attacks over networks via email, texts, and online pop-ups and ads, etc. A slideshow presentation video was presented on Canvas LMS and a formative quiz was included.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
-What is identity theft? 
-What is an Internet scam? 
-What is private information and why is it not always safe to share it?
-What are some clues that indicate a type of phishing scam? 
-What is important to know about shortened URLs?
-What should you do if you a message, email, or a text that you suspect is a phishing scam?
## OBJECTIVES
-Compare and contrast identity theft with other kinds of theft.
-Describe different ways that identity theft can occur online.
-Use message clues to identify examples of phishing.


## CATCH/HOOK
How can you protect yourself from phishing?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I recorded a video of myself going through the slide presentation and describing and explaining situations and examples of identity theft consequences, Internet scams, phishing techniques, and how to protect oneself from such attacks. The lesson provides good examples of phishing scams with clues for students to decipher. This practice related to questions on the quiz.

## REVIEW
I recorded my lesson as a Screencastify video and posted it to my Canvas 6th grade library page. The students could review the material as many times as they choose, asynchronously. Also, I could review the material again by providing feedback to the students individually, regarding any missed questions on the quiz, to clear up any misunderstandings and allow students to redo the quiz if need be. Obviously, this lesson is best done synchronously in person in a classroom or over a zoom meeting, to provide immediate feedback and allow for clarifying questions, but that option was not available to me when I posted this lesson.
