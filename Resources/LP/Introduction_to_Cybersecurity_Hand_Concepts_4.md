title: Introduction to Cybersecurity Hand Concepts
description: This lesson will take two days to go over the 6 parts of the hand in relation to cybersecurity. We will do a general overview then have instruction and student work time for all of the 6 parts: Confidentiality (index), integrity (ring), Availability (thumb), Think like an Adversary (middle), Keep it Simple (Pinky), and Defense in Depth (Palm). Finally, at the end of the two days, we will wrap up knowledge and allow students work time to finish any activities. For Part 1, we will focus on Think like an Adversary (middle), Keep it Simple (Pinky), and Defense in Depth (Palm).

## Lesson Plan
### Overview
This lesson will take two days to go over the 6 parts of the hand in relation to cybersecurity. We will do a general overview then have instruction and student work time for all of the 6 parts: Confidentiality (index), integrity (ring), Availability (thumb), Think like an Adversary (middle), Keep it Simple (Pinky), and Defense in Depth (Palm). Finally, at the end of the two days, we will wrap up knowledge and allow students work time to finish any activities. For Part 1, we will focus on Think like an Adversary (middle), Keep it Simple (Pinky), and Defense in Depth (Palm).


### PRE/POST-TEST
Pre: What do you already know about cyber security?
Post: What have you learned about cyber security?


### OBJECTIVES
Students Will Be Able To (SWBAT) identify the 6 parts of the hand and how they relate to cybersecurity.
SWBAT compare and contrast the 6 different parts of the hand and their relationship with cybersecurity.


### CATCH/HOOK
Students will trace out their hand on a paper and label them.
