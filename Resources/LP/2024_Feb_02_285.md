title: Microbit Escape Room Puzzle - Magnetic Alarms
description: In this project, you and a partner will create an alarm that will go off when a magnet is moved away from the microbit. In many escape rooms, magnetic sensors are used to detect if certain objects are placed in the correct position. To make our program easier to troubleshoot, we will have our microbit make a noise when a magnet is moved close to it.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this project, you and a partner will create an alarm that will go off when a magnet is moved away from the microbit. In many escape rooms, magnetic sensors are used to detect if certain objects are placed in the correct position. To make our program easier to troubleshoot, we will have our microbit make a noise when a magnet is moved close to it.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is the function of a “forever” code block?
What code/block can be used to have your program do one action if something is true, or another action if it is false?
How does a “show string” block work?
How does a “ring tone” block work?
What does the “magnetic force” code block do?
## OBJECTIVES
Correctly use a forever loop to keep parts of their code running continuously
Use an If/else statement to have their program behave differently under different conditions
Use various coding blocks and logic states to have their microbit react to a magnetic field.


## CATCH/HOOK
Demonstrate a working microbit magnetic alarm that starts to play a noise when a magnet is moved far enough away from it. Ask students what they think is happening physically and what is happening in the code.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Use makecode.microbit.org to create a magnetic alarm - that is to have your microbit play a noise when a magnet is moved away from it.


BEFORE YOU BEGIN CODING:
FInd the following blocks of code, right click on them, and select the “help” option. Then read the documentation for that block so that you understand how it works! You will have to search through the block options on the left side of the screen to find each of these.
“Forever” block
“If…else” block
“Show string” block
“Ringtone (hz)” block
“Magnetic force” block


Your program should do the following:
Display the magnetic force number on the screen when the microbit is measuring a magnetic field strength less than 400.
Play some sort of noise when the microbit measures a magnetic field strength of more than 400.


Now that you have read about all the blocks you need, it is time to start coding and testing!

## REVIEW
Have random pairs of students demonstrate their magnetic alarm and briefly explain their code.
