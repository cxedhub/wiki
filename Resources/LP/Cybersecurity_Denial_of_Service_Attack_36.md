## Lesson Plan
### Overview
In this fun lesson plan, students will model one type of attack (Denial-of-Service attack) and figure out how to protect the network against it (no computer programming required)!


### PRE/POST-TEST
https://www.sciencebuddies.org/teacher-resources/lesson-plans/worksheet-cybersecurity-denial.pdf


### OBJECTIVES
1. Execute a denial-of-service attack on a model of a computer network.
2. Determine quantitative metrics that can measure the impact of a denial-of-service attack.
3. Design and test a solution to prevent a denial-of-service attack on a model of a computer network.


### CATCH/HOOK
Have you ever felt frustrated at being unable to access a favorite website or online game? Did you realize the site might have been a victim of a cyber-attack? If you aren't careful about online security, your computer could even be used to launch the attack!


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Cybersecurity for Beginners Lesson Plan Objective: To introduce high school students to the basics of cybersecurity and the risks of cyber-attacks and to help them develop critical thinking skills to identify and protect against cyber-attacks. Materials: -Internet access -Whiteboard/chalkboard -Colored cards -Pens/pencils Procedure: 1. Introduce the basics of cybersecurity to the students. Explain what a cyber-attack is, how it works, and the types of attacks (such as denial-of-service attacks). 2. Explain the importance of protecting networks and data and how cybersecurity professionals do this. 3. Divide the class into groups of 9-12 students. Have each group designate roles, such as clients, Internet, server, guard, and attacker. 4. Explain the process of information flow from client to server and how a DoS attack can be launched. 5. Have each group act out the process using colored cards. Have the clients write requests on the cards, the Internet transport the cards, and the server process the requests. 6. Have the guard (representing a firewall) identify and block illegitimate requests. 7. Have the attacker flood the system with requests to simulate a DoS attack. 8. Let the students be the cybersecurity personnel, identify cyber-attacks, and find creative ways to protect the service against the attacks. 9. Discuss the activity and the importance of cybersecurity. 10. Assign any further research or reading on the subject.






### REVIEW
Discuss the importance of cybersecurity and how understanding the threats and strategies for protection can help prevent cyber-attacks. Encourage students to continue learning about cybersecurity and practice their skills.


### STANDARDS        
NGSS Alignment: MS-ETS1-3. Analyze data from tests to determine similarities and differences among several design solutions to identify the best characteristics of each that can be combined into a new solution to better meet the criteria for success.
MS-ETS1-4. Develop a model to generate data for iterative testing and modification of a proposed object, tool, or process such that an optimal design can be achieved.
