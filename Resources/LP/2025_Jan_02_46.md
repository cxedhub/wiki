# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson introduces the process by which information is sent between computers and networks as packets of binary code on the Internet, as well as how to use effective Internet search strategies to enhance search efficiency, relevance, and accuracy.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
-What happens digitally when an information request is made during an Internet browser or database search?  
-How are algorithms used in the coding of search engines to enable them to work efficiently? 
-What are effective search strategies that can help you receive the appropriate search results you need?
## OBJECTIVES
-Understand the steps by which information is translated, transmitted, and processed in order to flow through hardware and software to complete tasks (5.CS.HS.01). 
-Understand how information is broken down into smaller pieces, transmitted as packets through multiple devices over networks and the Internet, and reassembled at the destination (5.NI.NCO.01).  
-Students plan and employ effective research strategies to locate information and other resources for their intellectual or creative pursuits (ISTE 3A).


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine you could shrink yourself like Ant-man to a sub-particle size and travel through the structures of computers, networks, and the Internet. Imagine what you would see as information travels across networks and the Internet.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Please see the attached Lesson/Activity document attached below for the full activity list for more details. This lesson/activity provides information about the process of information packet transfer through binary code language, a practice demonstration activity that illustrates this process, and practice in employing effective, relevant, and accurate Internet search strategies.

## REVIEW
Please see the attached document linked to the previous question. This is a review process comprised of reviewing with the students a Google slides presentation about Binary Code and it's structure, as well as a document that will help the instructor review basic Internet search strategies.
