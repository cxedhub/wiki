## Lesson Plan
### Overview
"The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) is an international network of antennas that provide the communication links between the scientists and engineers on Earth to the missions in space and on Mars."  Student will learn  about the mars missions, and learn how to make a encrypted messages" Students will


### PRE/POST-TEST
Why is confidentiality important? What are ways we can keep our messages safe.  How does Florida's involvement in Space exploration affect our economy


### OBJECTIVES
With guidance, identify and model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (sets of step-by- step instructions) to complete tasks (e.g.,
verbally, kinesthetically, .  Students will  Summarize the effects of space exploration on the economy and culture of Florida. Student will state learn the purpose of security, (depth of defense.


### CATCH/HOOK
today students will  read about the Mars mission,  and the purpose of needing to think like an adversary and the importance of the depth of defense.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Starter : Talk about all the ways of we defend ourself,  Lead students to defense in our home, school, laptops and country.  
direct instruction
Review The hand concept dept of defense and confidentiality using any available resources/
Have students read about mars mission and what are some defense Ideas that the mission needs to think about in order to protect machinery, technology and perhaps people on mars.
Have student learn about cyphers and encrypted messages.
Have students creates an encrypted message to people on mars with cipher and have their classmate solve the messages
For the extensions: Students will create a cipher with microbits and share what they did with classmates






### REVIEW
student will review why depth of defense has to be considered with space exploration


### STANDARDS        
SC.8.E.5.12, Summarize the effects of space exploration on the economy and culture of Florida.
