## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Elementary students will be able to identify the meaning of "password". Students will explain reasons why a strong password is important. Students will create an example of a memorable and strong password.

Identify the meaning of "password".


Explain reasons why a strong password is important.


Create an example of a memorable and strong password.


### CATCH/HOOK
We will build our own versions of "Matt's Coder/Decoder from the Cyberchase show on PBS.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Pretest.
Invite kids to sit at table with different kinds of locks. (Combination lock, deadbolt lock etc.  Ask them to explain what these things are use for and what happens when we don’t have them. 
Explain the meaning of “password” and any other important terms.  Consider using a matching game. 
Discuss the necessity and consequences of strong/weak secret password .
Distribute and project the Cyberchase Coder/Decoder Handout. Say: One way to make a strong password is to start with system that exchangs some of  your letters or numbers
Create the Cyberchase Coder/Decoder.  Follow directions on attachment.
Lastly, allow students to make a password. They should work independently to create it, Ask if anyone wants to share there creation. Then remind them before they start to say it: “NO WAY! It’s a secret! Don’t share it with the group!”
