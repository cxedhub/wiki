## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
what is coding and how can you use it?
## OBJECTIVES
for this lesson the hour of code project will be what students complete in this lesson with me- the follow up will be with their teachers/class


## CATCH/HOOK
show some of the videos of completed coding projects, ask them if they think they can create that?
