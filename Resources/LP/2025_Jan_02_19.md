# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will be introduced to the concept of data/information transfer across computer devices and the Internet, introduced to binary code as a means to understanding how computers communicate digitally, as well as getting a better understanding of how to use effective search strategies while doing research via browser search engines and databases.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What happens digitally when an information request is made during an Internet browser or database search?  
How are algorithms used in the coding of search engines to enable them to work efficiently? 
What are effective search strategies that can help you receive the appropriate search results you need?
## OBJECTIVES
Understand the steps by which information is translated, transmitted and processed in order to flow through hardware and software to complete tasks (5.CS.HS.01). 
Understand how information is broken down into smaller pieces, transmitted as packets through multiple devices over networks and the Internet, and reassembled at the destination (5.NI.NCO.01). 
Give examples and explain how computing technologies have changed the world and express how those technologies influence and are influenced by cultural practices (5.IC.C.01).  
Students plan and employ effective research strategies to locate information and other resources for their intellectual or creative pursuits (ISTE 3A).


## CATCH/HOOK
Imagine you could shrink yourself like Ant-man to a sub-particle size and travel through the structures of computer devices, networks and the Internet. Imagine what you would see as information travels across networks and the Internet.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be introduced to how data/information transfer works between computers, networks and over the Internet and will practice taking roles in a simulation of data transfer requests from initial searchs to end results in an unplugged, collaborative learning activity. Students will also be introduced to effective search strategies and will practice together how to use them to produce efficient and accurate results.
