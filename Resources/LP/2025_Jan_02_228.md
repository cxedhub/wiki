# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson uses familiar nursery rhymes to introduce secondary students to the concepts of coding, sequencing, and looping with microbits. Students in a STEM Class will outline code for their for a nursery rhyme that will eventually be read to kindergarten students. This will be implemented with Science course and integrated through the library.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are terms used for logic loops?
What is an algorithm?
What is the use of a loop?
What does a 'for' loop do?
What does an 'if' loop do?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to write an outline of their code.
Students will be able to find iterations in a nursery rhyme.
Students will be able to identify simplifications in their code.


## CATCH/HOOK
Read “10 little monkeys” to the STEM students. Have them identify themes and loops. Share-out stories if they have read this or something similar.
For example, I would sing this song to myself as I would swim the 500 yards in high school to help me keep track of my laps.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
After listening to the story, students will examine how the song is an example of a sequence and loop in coding.
Have them grab a piece of paper and start to outline their code:
On start, show message “ten little monkeys jumping on the bed”
If - one monkey falls off then Momma calls the doctor
If momma calls the doctor then nine monkeys jump on bed
And loop through the end

## REVIEW
How does writing/typing out an outline for our code help us later? 
How will this help you write code in python?
