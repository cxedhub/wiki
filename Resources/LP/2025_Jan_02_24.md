# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will learn about how hardware needs software in order for it to do something. Students will create a program for the micro|bit to display different icons on the LEDs. They will use the finite and infinite loops to create a flashing pattern on the micro|bit and then create their own icon to be displayed.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1.    What is a Micro:bit?
2.    How does a pause block work?
3.    What is the difference between a finite and infinite loop?
## OBJECTIVES
Identify the difference between the finite loop and the infinite loop.
Identify where to place a pause block in the code.
Create a program that controls the LEDs on the micro:bit.


## CATCH/HOOK
What if you could have a mini billboard in your pocket? What would it display?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will learn that the micro:bit is a piece of hardware. Show a picture of the micro:bit that shows all the integrated components. In order for the LEDs to light, the students will need to write a program (software) that controls the lights of the LEDs. Students will watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqBmvHD5bCw
to learn about LEDs on the micro:bit.
Students will then be introduced to the micro:bit programming interface. They will create a program that allows an icon to blink a certain number of times and another icon that blinks a certain number of times.  This will reinforce the concept of a finite loop.  They will then place inside the forever loop so that the pattern will continue indefinitely.
Next students will create their own icon(s) using the blank show LEDs block and place into the different loops to create their own design.  Then students will be introduced to plotting the LEDs, if theyâ€™ve finished creating their own icons.
Finish with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GpF9z1rKBM
To relate the portable billboard in their pocket with digital billboards, made of LEDs.

## REVIEW
Students will show off their programs on the micro:bit to each other. They will talk about their programs and the reason they chose to design them the way they did.  Together as a group, have a discussion about what they enjoyed, what was a challenge and what they would do differently next time. Also ask what they would like to learn more about in the future.
