# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using Seesaw, students will complete the maze to get Santa Claus to the Christmas tree ensuring that he gets two cookies and a glass of milk along the way. Students must drag and drop coding arrows to the boxes to help Santa know what direction to go in. Students must use computational thinking to figure out how to get Santa on his way!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What arrows can we use to get Santa to the tree?
## OBJECTIVES
1. The student will demonstrate an understanding of using coding arrows to complete a maze by using up, down, left, and right arrows.
2. The student will demonstrate an understanding of programming by using step by step instructions to help Santa reach his tree.


## CATCH/HOOK
Tell the students the teacher wants to get to her desk but needs their help to get there because they do not know which way to go. Have students use their pointer finger to point me in the direction of where I am going. Explain to students that they just used high thinking skills to help me get to where I wanted to go.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Explain to students that they will be guiding Santa to a tree just like they guided me to my desk. 
2. Pass out the Ipads to students and have them go on the SeeSaw app. 
3. Tell students that they will be using the coding arrows to get Santa in the direction that he needs to go. Tell students that it is like a maze. 
4. Tell students that there are some guidelines that they must follow. They need to make sure that Santa gets two cookies and a glass of milk on his way to the tree. 
5. Tell the students that when they are done, they will press the green check to turn it in to the teacher.

## REVIEW
Have some of the students come to the document camera to show how they got Santa to reach the tree.
