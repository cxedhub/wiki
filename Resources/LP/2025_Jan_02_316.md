# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Create a scoreboard you can use with your microbit. Create a program that you can use to keep score with your games.
## Meta description
+ *Subject Area:* Computer Science 
+ *Grade Level :* 6-8 
+ *Computer Science Domains:*
   + Computing Systems, Algorithms and Programming
+ *Computer Science Principles:*
   + Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems
+ *Materials:* 
   + Micro:bit
+ *Considerations:*
   + Check the children’s algorithms before they start programming. When they have finished, children can participate in a small ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ tournament to test that their program works, allowing them to see their coding programming skills come to life.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Create a scoreboard you can use with your microbit. Create a program that you can use to keep score with your games.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre-Test Questions:  
Can you define vocabulary words: algorithm, decompose, program, debug, code blocks, scoreboard 
Which blocks do you think you will need?
What inputs/outputs will your program have?
What variables will you use?


Post-Test Questions:
Which operations produced the same result? 
Are you more familiar with how the micro:bit program works?
What notes did you make about what you discovered? 
What were some of the obstacles you faced when trying to recreate/prove your answer or solution with the microbits?
## OBJECTIVES
Students gain practical experience of writing computer programs to solve problems.
Students evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies analytically to solve problems
Students will be responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology.
Students can debug a program
Students will use algorithms to perform investigations


## CATCH/HOOK
Many of you have created a 'rock/paper/scissor' game for your microbit.   Now you will be able to keep score.  You will be programming the micro:bit to be a scoreboard for a ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’ championship. Every time ‘Player One’ wins a round, they press button A, every time ‘Player Two’ wins a round, they press button B. When someone shakes the micro:bit, you will get told how many rounds ‘Player One’ has won and how many rounds ‘Player Two’ has won.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Before you begin programming, you need to first write the algorithm for it by thinking about each of the blocks they will need to create the scoreboard program that was on the micro:bit.  Ask yourself -Which blocks you think you’ll need?
What inputs/outputs your program will have?
How you will use variables?

## REVIEW
This activity would be utilized at other times throughout the year to review how algorithms, blocks, and other functions work on the microbit.
