## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Analysis of the Unreliable Narrator with Cyber Security


### PRE/POST-TEST
Analyze the impact of narration in a text and its subsequent meaning.
Apply the Cyber Security Concept of "The Hand" to investigate the reliability of narration.
Connecting the impact of the narration through the lens of cyber security (use textual evidence and deeper inference). Background information should be provided to students to support a deeper analysis and connections to inferences.


### OBJECTIVES
