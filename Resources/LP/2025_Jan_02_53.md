title: Kindergarten Beebot Number Identification (1-10) Activity with Movement
description: Bee-bots are utilized collaboratively by students to problem solve while reinforcing the skill of identifying numbers 1-10 in a variety of ways. Movement exercises that reinforce standard counting and one-to-one correspondence are also built into the activity. Many of these activities focus on crossing mid-line which is crucial especially for reading in early grades.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Bee-bots are utilized collaboratively by students to problem solve while reinforcing the skill of identifying numbers 1-10 in a variety of ways. Movement exercises that reinforce standard counting and one-to-one correspondence are also built into the activity. Many of these activities focus on crossing mid-line which is crucial especially for reading in early grades.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Are students able to accurately identify numbers 1-10 in a variety of formats (numeral, ten frame, dice, 5-group, picture, scattered, domino)?


Are students able to count in standard order for numbers 1-10 to perform the correct amount of exercises (one-to-one correspondence)?


Are students able to create and follow an algorithm to find the appropriate destination with the Beebot?


Are students able to decompose and explain the steps necessary to program the Beebot to solve the task?


Are students able to demonstrate fundamental locomotor, body control, and movement concepts including crossing midline?


Are students able to work collaboratively to solve the problem?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will identify the numbers 1-10 represented in a variety of ways (numeral, ten frame, 5 groups, dice, scattered, domino, picture).


Students will demonstrate one-to-one correspondence when counting objects in the range of 1-10.


Students will use a Beebot to create an algorithm to reach the appropriate destination on the Beebot mat.


Students will decompose the steps needed to solve the task with the Beebot.


Students will demonstrate fundamental locomotor, body control, and movement concepts including crossing midline.


Students will apply knowledge of counting in standard order for numbers 1-10 to perform the correct amount of exercises.


Students will work collaboratively to solve the problem.


## CATCH/HOOK
The Beebot introduction/refresher. What do you think a Bee-bot does?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Activity Steps:
Pre-activity prep: Print attached cards. The larger cards can be
placed at various locations on a Beebot mat. The numeral cards
should be stacked in one pile, the exercise cards should be
stacked in another pile.
Pre-requisite knowledge: Students should be familiar with a
Beebot and the basics of programming it. Students should be
proficient at identifying numeral numbers 1-5 or 1-10.


1. Begin the lesson by sharing learning targets with students
(Ex: I will count objects within 10. I will program a Beebot to
go to the correct number. I will perform the correct number of
exercises)
2. If needed, give students a quick refresher course in Beebot
operation.
3. Explain to students that they will be using their knowledge of
number identification and counting to problem solve and do
some fun exercises.
4. In small groups (2-4 students) explain and demonstrate the
activity to students. Beebot maps should already be set up
for the groups along with the 2 piles of cards (numeral cards,
exercise cards). First, students should draw a numeral card
(ex: 5). Then, the group will work together to find a matching
number of objects on the Beebot mat (there is more than
one correct answer). Once they have decided where they
want to go, they should collaborate to decompose the steps
needed to reach the appropriate location. Then students
should enter the program on the Beebot. If it ends up at the
correct location, students will then draw an exercise card
and perform that number of exercises (so if they drew the
numeral 5, they will perform 5 of that exercise). If the Beebot
did NOT reach the intended location, they should collaborate
to problem solve to figure out how to reprogram the Beebot
to get to the correct location. Offer scaffolding and
encouragement as needed. Have students participate in the
activity for 10-20 minutes.

## REVIEW
When finished, reflect on the learning experience. Ask
students if they met their learning targets. Ask them what
they liked and didnâ€™t like about the activity. Ask them what
they want to work on getting better at for next time.
