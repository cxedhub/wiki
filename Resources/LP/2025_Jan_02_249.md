   + No technology required, a deck of cards, or a memory game etc to have like images, split into two different piles, making sure that there is a paired match for each image.  Student Computer Science Notebooks, they will use these all year long to keep track of their own understanding.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Candy Burglar| Password Lesson Students will each receive a card with a symbol or word on it. The symbol will match with one other card. Students will learn how a password protects the information (bowl of candy) that they have stored in a computer or on the internet.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Why do we use a password on our devices?
How do passwords work?
## OBJECTIVES
Students can explain that their symbol must match to enter the group, we will build understanding that the symbol is a password


Passwords protect our information


## CATCH/HOOK
You have to run an errand and leave your home for a few hours. You have a bowl of candy on your kitchen counter. The candy is just for you and your family. No one else is supposed to eat the candy. There is a candy thief in town. You need to keep the candy safe. 




I want the students to arrive at the question that they need to ask about keeping things safe.


How do you keep the candy safe from a burglar?


The students might answer, lock the door,


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Lesson Activity and Description




I will present the scenario of the candy burglar above.


Discussion time: 


Allow students a few minutes to discuss how they would protect the candy.  They might come up with ideas of traps or locking the door etc.




Activity:


Hand out cards, have the students find the person who matches their card, this could be done as wandering around the room until they find their match. 


Once the students have their matching group they should stay with that person.

## REVIEW
Review:


Follow up discussion:


The person who has your matching image can access the candy bowl on your kitchen counter, they have the secret code or the password that allows them to enter your house and share your candy.


When we have important information or things that we want to keep safe, or share with only certain people, we create a password to keep it safe.




Journal:


Have the students draw a picture in their Computer Science notebook of a bowl of candy and their card for the day.  Any words that they can write to describe keeping important things safe.
