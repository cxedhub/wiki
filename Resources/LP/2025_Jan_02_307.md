# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use coding to develop animation and sound for a music simulator. students will demonstrate locating and uploading a sound file to the computer. Students will develop a program to display animation form the computer to simulate an instrument.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can we design a computer to simulate an instrument
## OBJECTIVES
Students will demonstrate understanding of coding.
Students will demonstrate ability to search for information.


## CATCH/HOOK
lets make music happen


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Have students pick a favorite instrument
Ask them how we can create that instrument using the Lego Mindstorms.
Have them design their instrument. 
Ask how we can program the computer to animate the instrument, when you act upon it it plays a note, or when a note is played it moves. 
What sounds do you want to hear
Assist students in finding sound files
develop code to make your instrument work
