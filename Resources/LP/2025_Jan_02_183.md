# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The teacher will present a problem to the class, such as 'How do you get dressed in the morning?' Discuss that we will create an algorithm (steps to take) to show how we get dressed. Share that there is a correct order, such as, 'do you put your pants on before your underwear?'. Complete the steps together, individually paste sequence pictures in the correct order, Continue on about how do we transition to the bathroom? Create an algorithm to solve the problem.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Paste pictures in correct sequence of how to get dressed.
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to plan and complete tasks with peers
Students will be able to move through transitions with minimal direction.
Students will be able to create and follow algorithms to complete daily tasks.


## CATCH/HOOK
Ask sequence questions 'How do you get dressed in the morning?' Make silly statements 'I will put my pants on then put my underwear on right?'


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
*As a group, discuss how the students get dressed in the morning.  
*Make silly mistakes saying that I put my pants on first, then my underwear. 
*Let students tell you the correct steps for getting dressed, Write their responses on the white board. 
*Introducing the word “Algorithm” 
*Paste in order, pictures of steps for getting dressed 
*Tell students that we have another problem, it is time for a bathroom break, create algorithm to solve the problem 
*The teacher will guide the students to discover that there are steps that need to be taken for the entire class to be able to walk to the bathroom at the same time. 
*Using the SMART Board, the teacher will assist students with drawing a “map” of the room. 
*With teacher guidance, the class will list and draw the steps needed to transition to the bathroom. 
*The teacher will walk the class to the bathroom.
