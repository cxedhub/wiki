Students will read articles and then construct a timeline of the progression of communication technology in the developing United States.

+ *Considerations:*
   + - This lesson is divided into two parts to span over a minimum of two days. 
- The programming in this lesson is a bit sophisticated, so scaffold as necessary for students unfamiliar with MicroBits.  Microsoft provides an Activity Tutorial on how to code the Micro:Bits to be used with Morse Code. 
- The Micro:Bit Activity requires the radio feature.  You will likely want to pre-set and determine Radio Groups for successful code transmission. 
- Extension Opportunities: Provide more savvy students with the Activity Tutorial and let them work to follow procedural text directions to write and program the code without adult/whole class support.  
- If your school has access to the Wyoming Crossroads of a Continent text, you can utilize the sections in this book in lieu of or in addition to the provided links.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will read articles and then construct a timeline of the progression of communication technology in the developing United States. Then, they will use MicroBits to encode and decode messages sent in Morse Code via radio output. (Note| Morse Code Activity can be done Unplugged, without the Micro|Bits if necessary.)
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Why did the Pony Express end?
How did the Transcontinental Railroad improve communication?
How did the telegraph change communication?
How does the telegraph relate to the way we communicate today?
Which form of historical communication do you think is the best?  Why?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Construct a timeline of communication technology. 
- Describe the Pony Express, Transcontinental Railroad, and telegraph’s roles in communication. 
2. Describe the impact of technology on communication.
- Argue which communication form is most effective and why?
3. Collaborate to encode and decode a message written in Morse Code using the Micro:Bit.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will examine a series of images and short videos (see Google Slides) and then discuss observations in pairs and then as a whole group.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Part 1 - Historical Context
1. Students watch Hook videos and converse with partners about noticings and generate questions.  Reconvene as a class and ask a few pairs to share their observations or wonderings.
2. Students will read through the articles about the Pony Express, Transcontinental Railroad, and telegraph. 
3. Students will identify between 5-8 key events in the history of communication (from the articles), and construct a timeline.
4. Students will share their timelines in pairs, and discuss which form of communication they think was the best, and why. 


Part 2 - Micro:Bit Morse Code 
1. Tell students that today, they are going to spend more time examining the telegraph.  
2. Show Morse Code graphic, and ask students to make some observations and share any questions they may have.  
- Why was a different code necessary to communicate via telegraph?
- What kind of an impact did the telegraph have on how people communicated?
3. Pass out handout.  Have students write a secret message and then translate it into Morse Code for use later in the lesson.  
4. Explain activity:
- Students are going to work together to use the Micro:Bits to send and receive messages using Morse Code.  
5. Assign partners or work groups.
6. Discuss the Radio tab on the Make Code interface.  Discuss with students that these blocks direct the transmission of and reception of information from one Micro:Bit to another.  
7. Assign Radio Groups to pairs (or groups) of students.
8. Have students get their devices and go to https://makecode.microbit.org.  If working in pairs, each student needs their device.  If working in small groups, two computers are necessary per group.  
9. Guide students through building the code necessary to send and receive messages on their Micro:Bit.  Think aloud and discuss with students the function that each block serves in the program as they build the program as you model it.  
10. Once codes are built, have students download the code to their Microbit and send a test signal to their partner.  Have them test that each button input is being received properly.  If not, challenge them to check their code and make sure they don’t have any bugs!
11. Have teams work together to send and receive their messages.  Students should record their received message on their worksheet, then try to decode their partner’s secret word. 
12. Once the message has been successfully received, switch partners.

## REVIEW
Reconvene students to reflect on the activity.  Ask them to reflect on their learning over the past few days.  
Discussion Questions:
-Why did the Pony Express end?
-How did the Transcontinental Railroad improve communication?
-How did the telegraph change communication?
-How does the telegraph relate to the way we communicate today?
-Which form of historical communication do you think is the best?  Why?
