# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will explore the functions of the MIcro:bit. Students have not had experience with this and I have very little. Together, we will learn basic programming operations using makecode.mirobit.org tutorials. Students will work in pairs/groups to complete tasks such as programing dice and a name tag.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will explore the functions of the MIcro:bit. Students have not had experience with this and I have very little. Together, we will learn basic programming operations using makecode.mirobit.org tutorials. Students will work in pairs/groups to complete tasks such as programing dice and a name tag.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What codes do you have to use to turn your Micro:bit into a die?
What codes do you have to use to turn your Micro:bit into a name tag?
## OBJECTIVES
I can complete a specific programing task on a Micro:bit by observing tutorials and working collaboratively with my partner.


## CATCH/HOOK
Hand out Micro:bits to each group. Give them time to make observations. After a few minutes give them a battery pack to plug in and make new observations. These few moments of observation will likely spark their curiosity.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
After the hook (maybe during), make sure to discuss the safety instructions of the device. 






Work through the tutorial as a class on how to program dice using makecode.mirobit.org. Give students time with their partners to go through each step.

## REVIEW
Discuss which codes we used for what tasks and how those specific codes could be used to program something different.


Assess.
