# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will begin with background knowledge of reading materials about water and clouds. Students will then review knowledge from science standards of 2nd grade dealing with states of matter. Them they will have an experiment where they trap water droplets to make a cloud.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How are clouds formed?
## OBJECTIVES
carry out an investigation using a model.  They will also engage in discussions based on observations.  They will understand how weather data is collected and interpreted.


## CATCH/HOOK
Take students outside and have them look at the sky.  Have them describe what they are seeing.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Read Stories
2.  Go outside
3. Watch videos  (3 videos)
