# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Explaining what algorithms are and how computers use them.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1. What is an algorithm?
2. How do algorithms help us?
3. Why do computers need algorithms?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Complete a task using an algorithm
2. Understand what algorithms are
3. Understand when we use algorithms in daily tasks


## CATCH/HOOK
Show an origami completed and ask how this was made.
or
Show a computer doing something:
How did that computer know how to do that? What would we need to do to
get the computer to do what I want it to?
or
When I make a PBJ sandwich I do it in the same order every time. Why do you
think I do that? If I had someone else make me a sandwich how would they
know how I like my sandwiches made?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1. Computers use algorithms to tell them what they should do. In order
for the computer to receive an algorithm someone has to write the
algorithm or code. Today we are going to learn what an algorithm is and
how important they are to a computer.
2. Define the following vocabulary and talk about what they are and
how we use them.
a. Sequence: A sequence is when you put the instructions in the
order they need to be in to accomplish the task. Chances are,
your origami instructions are
b. Algorithms: Algorithms are basically just the sequence of steps
you take to accomplish a task. Origami is laid out so nicely
already, all you have to do is follow each step. This is an
algorithm.


3. So we need to understand what an algorithm is in order to be ready to
make an algorithm. We need algorithms to teach a computer what it
needs to do to give you an end result.
4. Read a book to bring a connection into reading. Help start their interest
in origami. (Choose from the list above according to your students
intereset level.)
a. In the book we read did you see any algorithms being used?
b. yes, steps they followed to make the origami
5. Origami Unplugged Coding Activity: Today we are going to see how we
can find an algorithm in many different tasks. Lets look at how using
origami can be an algorithm.
a. To start: In this origami activity, your partner will teach YOU
how to make a simple origami creation by giving you specific
instructions to complete the task. The catch is that you will be
sitting back to back so your partner will have to be very specific


and detailed in their instructions so that you can create the
origami correctly!
b. It is very important to explain the instructions step-by-step,
completing a task the same way a computer would. Just like in
this activity, computers don’t have an idea of what the final
program is supposed to look like. You need very detailed and
accurate instructions in order to complete the task properly.


6. Step By Step Instructions:
a. They KEY to this algorithm activity is that your origami ‘coder’
needs to explain the algorithm WITHOUT you looking at the
visual instructions.
i. Sit back to back with your partner.
ii. Each person starts with an unfolded square piece of
paper.
iii. Have your partner teach you how to make this simple
origami creation by explaining the instructions to you as
they create it too. They will use the origami instruction
sheet to create the origami but you will not be able to
look at the instructions when they are explaining it!
iv. Compare creations! When you are done building your
creation, turn around and see if you got it right!
b. By not being able to SHOW you the instructions, your partner or
‘origami coder’ will learn just how challenging algorithms are for
computers! Computers don’t have eyes to see. They need to be
given VERY SPECIFIC and exact instructions with lots of detail. If
computers aren’t given the correct instructions, the final
outcome can turn out really silly!
c. If your partner gives you some instructions that aren’t quite
right, follow through with them in your origami design. Then
when you compare at the end, you might note some pretty
funny errors! That’s ok, errors are part of programming.
7. Now we just have to debug our errors. Figure out where we went
wrong and how we can correct it better for the future.
8. The basics of any coding language involve the concepts of algorithms,
sequences, decomposition, and being able to debug a problem that
might come up anytime you write or complete an algorithm.

## REVIEW
1. What is an algorithm?
2. Why does a computer need an algorithm?
3. What do we do if we follow the algorithm but it doesn’t come out
correctly?
