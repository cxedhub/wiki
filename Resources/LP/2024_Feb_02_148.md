# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand.  This is the second of a three lesson unit that offers 5th graders a historical look at one example of a real world cyber attack that took place at an Australian WasteWater Facility in 2001.  The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Soc Studies, Science, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security.

+ *Considerations:*
   + Students will most likely need help understanding the various impacts pointed out.  Economic impact on the hotel that had to close due to sewage waste dumped into the greens of their property.  Closing meant no money could be made.  Health and environment impacts should be fairly 'common knowledge' for students, but certainly worth discussing so students include the information in their Google Presentations.


# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Cybersecurity and personal information protection go hand in hand.  This is the second of a three lesson unit that offers 5th graders a historical look at one example of a real world cyber attack that took place at an Australian WasteWater Facility in 2001.  The lesson is easily adaptable for 3rd grade and up through high school integrating ELA, Soc Studies, Science, and CS standards through the lens of real-world cyber security.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What are some of the impacts of cyber attacks?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students will accurately extract factual information from (three) teacher provided sources    
         while researching the Maroochy cyber attack. 


        Article #1
https://www.industrialcybersecuritypulse.com/throwback-attack-an-insider-releases-265000-gallons-of-sewage-on-the-maroochy-shire/


        Article #2
https://www.theregister.com/2001/10/31/hacker_jailed_for_revenge_sewage/


Video Clip (4 minutes)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_PRhTXp6VQ


2. Students will continue drafting a multimedia presentation that address the following:
                  A.  A quick summary of the event with factual text evidence (at least 3 facts from 
each source)
                  B.  Identifying which production, distribution, and consumption category that was 
                       affected in terms of needs, wants, goods, and services. 
                  C. Describe with 100% accuracy how the areas of health, economy, and 
the environment were impacted by this cyber attack.


## CATCH/HOOK
How can a keystroke from a computer cause a real stinky situation?  Today, we will explore exactly how that happened 20 years ago to a city in Australia.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Real World Cybersecurity Historical Event (45 minutes):
5 min  Think/Pair/Share reviewing two factor authentication. Intro daily focus of taking a 
closer look at a cyber attack that took place 20 years ago in Australia.  Teacher explains that they’ll be using two news articles and a video to research the Maroochy-Shire Waste Water Cyber Attack.  Teacher explains that the class will be split into three (10 minute) sessions.  


During the first 10 minute session, the class will divide into two teams.  One team will read and take notes in Google Slides on article #1, and the other team will read and take notes on Google slides regarding  article #2.


During the second 10 minute session, students will partner up with someone that read the other article to compare and contrast notes about the articles.  Highlighting similarities, and italicizing differences on their Google Slides.


For session three, the whole class will watch the video while jotting notes on their white boards.  After viewing the 4 minute video, students will work individually adding a google slide using the information from their white boards.


        10 min.  Session #1
The class will divide into two teams.  One team will read and take notes in Google Slides on article #1, and the other team will read and take notes on Google slides regarding  article #2.


        10 min. Sessions #2
                Students partner up with someone that read the other article to compare and 
contrast notes about the articles.  Highlighting similarities, and italicizing differences on their Google Slides.


        10 min. Session #3 
                For session three, the whole class will watch the video while jotting notes on their 
white boards.  After viewing the 4 minute video, students will work individually adding a google slide using the information from their white boards.
        
        10 min. Wrap Up
Project a few student volunteers’ working drafts on a classroom large screen to share findings with the whole class to generate consensus about similarities and differences among all three sources. 
 After a few students have quickly shown their work, tie lesson to;
1. The impacts this event had on the economy, health, and environment.  
2. What was learned through the lens of how (or if) two factor authentication may have averted this attack. 
3.  How we know we used reliable sources for our research.


 Close lesson with explaining to students that their task for tomorrow will be to research a more recent cyber attack to teach the class about.
