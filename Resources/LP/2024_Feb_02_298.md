# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson merges weather, microbit, programming and social impact.  Does the temperature of a classroom matter?  Yes! In PSD, the school calendar has been modified, school days have been cancelled, participants health have been compromised because of hot classrooms.  How can you tell when a classroom is too hot?  Easy!  Code a microbit!
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
It will be on a scale of 1-5 with Strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree with being able to do the above.  Given pre and post lesson.
## OBJECTIVES
1.Write/Create/Modify basic programs (using no-code interface; drag & drop) to:
Transform Raw Data based on our Units of Measure 
Perform Repetitive Tasks on Data
Make Decisions Based on Data 
Store and Retrieve Data  (*bonus at scale/post-processing)
2.Understand how CS, Science and Mathematics are dependent subjects (not subjects that are just teased out)
3.Discuss how CS has a societal (and very individual) impact!


## CATCH/HOOK
The hook will be Who Cares If Your Classroom is hot? Our building is often very, very hot.  My office used to average 85 degrees.  Kids have been physically sick, have got days off for heat and calendars have been modified.  Not to mention the effect on learning!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I have attached the very detailed Google Slides Presentation.  This is a one or two period lesson, so although it is quick, it has a hook, the learning (nested with collaboration and problem solving, plus content standards) an extension (convert F to C) and a discussion of how CS can impact social problems.
