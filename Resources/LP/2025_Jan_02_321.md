# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This lesson focusses on coding concept variable with and lesson from Code.Org.  The students will program the micro|bit to keep track of their steps.  Finally, the students will create their own fitness step counter strap.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can the student independently create a program and download it to micro:bit.  
Can the student troubleshoot and debug any issues?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to independently create a program and download it to micro:bit.   
Students can troubleshoot and debug any issues.


## CATCH/HOOK
Can you make your micro:bit into a micro:fit?  Program your micro:bit into its own step counter!


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
This lesson focuses on the coding concept variables from Code.Org.  Student program the micro:bit to keep track of their steps.  As an extension activity, students can create their own fitness step counter strap to attach to their wrist or ankles.


If this is students first experience with micro:bit view the first 3 minutes of the 
introduction video: micro:bit Tutorial Series Part 1:
http://bit.ly/envelope-variable-educators


If students need a lesson on variables, watch the following
http://bit.ly/envelope-variables-lesson


Finally, if you would like a video about the importance of tracking steps:
http://bit.ly/count-those-steps


Begin by making the variable called 'steps' and setting it to 0.  Every time the micro:bit is shaken it adds to the step count and shows it!

Extension:  It the students want and extra challenge, design an ankle or wrist strap to attach the micro:bit.  Make it comfortable to wear and lightweight.

## REVIEW
Review vocabulary words: algorithms, events, variables.


Discuss the coding which was done in order to get the micro:bits to work.  Were there any differences between the code the students used?


What issues occured?  What troubleshooting methods were used?  


What differences were there between the designs of the strap?
