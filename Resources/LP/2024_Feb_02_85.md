# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use a decoder to decode messages that lead to exploration of Digital Citizenship resources. They will then take what they learned to develop a Google Slide presentation with their group to share with the class and their parents.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is digital citizenship? Why is it important for you to be a good digital citizen?
## OBJECTIVES
I can conduct a short research project that will increase my understanding of digital citizenship. 
I can work collaboratively with others to develop a slide show that represents my understanding of digital citizenship and why it's important for me.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will solve riddles and use a secret decoder wheel to decipher challenges that they will complete with their group.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will be grouped in 3-4 students/group. Each group will be given a decoder wheel along with their first clue. As a team, students must solve the riddle, decipher the code, and complete each task that will lead to another clue. 
* Clue one will have students login into their school email where they will find a message with the second clue. 
* Clue 2 will have students locate a shared document that will lead to their next task
* Clue 3 will have students explore the resources on the shared document that include, videos, a website, and a game all related to digital citizenship 
* Clue 4 will have the students take what they learned and use it to complete a slide show presentation describing what digital citizenship is and why it is important

## REVIEW
The review will take place during short discussions after each group present their slide show.
