# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use popsicle sticks to design maze systems and work to create a flowchart that helps a user to find the exit of the maze every time.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Why is it important to use clear algorithmic design?
How do computer scientists solve complex problems using algorithms?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will describe the importance of clear algorithmic design. 
Students will create a flowchart to understand the process of solving complex problems.


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will receive a handout with a complex maze on it. Students will be asked to describe how they solve the maze and work to develop a set of instructions that work every time in every maze.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
1) Students will receive a handout of a maze and be asked to solve the maze. afterwards ask students to think pair share how they solved the maze. Ask students to then journal a short set of instructions that would help anyone solve a maze every time, restricting students to the use of directional coordinates and dead ends (can not say look for an opining). -5min


2)Pair students into small groups and have them work to combine their instructions into one system. -5min


3) Students will use 30 popsicle sticks in small groups to create their own maze system. -10 min


4)Students must then test their set of instructions noting any problem. Students will continue to work through their instructions until they work for their maze completely. -10 min


5) Students will trade spots with another team and test their instructions against 1 or 2 different mazes.  - 10 min


6) Students will develop a flow chart or other pseudo code, turning their directions into an algorithm.  - 10 min


7) students will share out their directions with another team. -5min

## REVIEW
Students will share their directions with another team and discuss how clear instructional methods were integral for their success.
