# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will use micro bit and/ or Lego EV3 with temperature sensor to record temperature in the room and outside of building to identify differences in temperature by location and time. Once we have collected data we will analyze for trends. We will determine where and when variances occur. We will problem solve to determine what interventions could help control temperature in the room to maintain student comfort level. Test ideas and collect data to determine best intervention to use.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How can you solve a problem?
What are the things you need to know to solve the problem?
What tools do you have to solve your problem?
## OBJECTIVES
1. Students will be able to analyze data and identify target information to determine focus of intervention. 
2. Student will be able to identify solutions for modifying situation to improve conditions.
3. Students will be able to explain the process used to complete this task.


## CATCH/HOOK
begin class by talking about how students learn best when they are comfortable in the physical space. 'It can often be difficult to learn when the room is too hot or too cold.  Let's discuss your thoughts on our room.'


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
prior to this lesson we will set up the temperature sensors by coding the sensor to provide real time data. 
We will develop a means to record and compile data for analysis
Once we collect the data we will discuss what it shows and what that might mean
using the information from the analysis we will refine the problem and brainstorm intervention tactics
once we have decided on an intervention we will implement an intervention and collect data to measure its effectiveness in solving the problem
We will try at least two different interventions in isolation and then a combination to find the most effective solution
We will discuss the process and look at takeaways
We will discuss how we can use this process to solve similar problems

## REVIEW
discuss the steps in the problem solving process.
Talk about the data collection ( what tools were used, how they were used, how they made the problem solving process easier)
talk about the interventions that were considered
talk about why some choices were rejected or accepted by the group
discuss outcomes
review the steps and talk about how we can improve the problem solving process
