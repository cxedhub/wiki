# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using Microbits to help students visualize the stages of Mitosis lesson can be used after the concept of Mitosis has been reviewed or taught.  This lesson can be used to address misconceptions or as a reinforcement for the stages of Mitosis.  Students are given a choice of how they can represent the stages of Mitosis.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
1)        When you cut your hand, how does the wound heal.  Can you explain what happens to the cut on a molecular level?
2)        What do you remember about mitosis?
3)        How does the body create new cells?
## OBJECTIVES
•        demonstrate the phases of mitosis. 
•        in multicellular organisms, individual cells grow and then divide via a process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow. 
•        use a model based on evidence to illustrate mitosis.


## CATCH/HOOK
Catch:       
After a wound, how does the skin heal itself on a molecular level?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will study the process of mitosis.  Once they have an understanding of the names and stages of mitosis, they will use a Microbit to create a program that names  and images of the different stage of mitosis.

## REVIEW
Students can complete a gallery walk and view other students' images on the Microbits.  This will allow students, who may be struggling, see other examples. 
There are ideas for addressing misconceptions of mitosis in the lesson.
