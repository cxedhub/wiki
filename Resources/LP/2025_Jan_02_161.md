# Lesson Plan
## Overview
The lesson is for coding with micro|bits. It is written broadly for implementation as an
activity for a whole group of students in a library/makerspace club or as a free-choice activity for small groups or individuals. However, it can be adapted for collaborative teaching to support various classroom curricula.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
How is coding related to the design cycle?
In what ways can we use computing devices to explore our environment?
In what ways can we use computing devices to communicate and collaborate with other learners?
How can coding help us express our creativity?
## OBJECTIVES
...create a computational artifact, using the tools and materials provided, through employing the design cycle.


...use software and hardware to explore coding and programming.


...work independently or in teams to engage appropriately with tools and materials provided, within the library space.


## CATCH/HOOK
Introduce micro:bits, wearing one as a name tag flashing = “Hello! my name is Mr. Hodgins! :)”


Show students that it is possible to activate other programs through other means (Shake the micro:bit for it to read “Hello!, My name remains Mr. Hodgins.”


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
● Make Instructional slideshow
● Post on library website
● Introduce micro:bits with name flashing = “Hello! my name
is Mr. Hodgins. :)”
● Show students that it is possible to activate other programs
through other means (Shake the micro:bit for it to read “
Hello!, My name remains Mr. Hodgins.”
● Introduce micro:bits site
● Instruct students how to gain access to library website and
micro:bits site.
● Determine purpose:
○ If working in collaboration with Classroom or Computer Science teacher, outline objectives
○ If working in Library Club, outline objectives
○ If allowing exploration during free periods, allow
students to explore the materials and encourage them to
share their results
● Allow students to explore micro:bits, steering them toward
projects appropriate to their present skills
● Help troubleshoot
● Encourage students to assist peers in troubleshooting
● Present projects (progress)
● Review and Reflect
○ Discuss how designing an algorithm and writing code and making a program are similar to the design cycle.
○ Discuss ways to use such tools for communication, collaboration, and creation.
○ Instruct students to fill out the Google Form to share their reflections.
