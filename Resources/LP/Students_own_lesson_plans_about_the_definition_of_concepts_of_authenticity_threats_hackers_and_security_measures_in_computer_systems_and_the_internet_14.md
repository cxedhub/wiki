## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will make their own videos and demonstrate how they are able to describe threats to modern digital computer systems, and to describe techniques of defense against
each threat. Also students should be able to describe the popular computer and network
security hacks that people use the most.


### PRE/POST-TEST
1-What information is safe to put out there?
2-How can you protect yourself?
3-Would you consider a career in Cyber Security?


### OBJECTIVES
1-Participation
2-Enthusiasm
3-Understanding of the subject
4- Progress in creating videos that describe the subject.


### CATCH/HOOK
I am smarter than the hackers :)
Follow up question by teacher:  Are you?


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I will ask my students if they are familiar with new ideas and innovation processes.
I will encourage them to exchange opinions with others with same answers and "friendly" argue with the opposite answers. Create a chart with answers.

Students will show their own videos on what they learned in this class.
