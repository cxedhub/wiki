# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will independently or collaboratively compare and contrast technology and how it has changed our lives and how technology devices have changed.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Collaboration Project-Based Learning: 
Create a song/rap as a group about these options: 
Differences/similarities between technology then versus now
How technology impacts everyday life at home and at school 
Real-World Application: How will I decide how to integrate technology and computer science into my future? What devices do I see myself using? 
Can use a recording device, class dojo portfolio, or microbit melody tab 
Formative Assessment: 
Google Doc Quiz 
Song presentation- create a common rubric whole group
## OBJECTIVES
Students will independently or collaboratively compare and contrast technology and how it has changed our lives and how technology devices have changed.
