## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Students will listen to a short presentation about three of the six cybersecurity hand concepts. Students will then be introduced to the micro bit through video and live demonstrations. and then we will move to the make code website.


### PRE/POST-TEST
What is cybersecurity?


### OBJECTIVES
Evaluate social networking sites and other online activity,


### CATCH/HOOK
Make the topic relatable by telling students where they expose themselves digitally on a daily basis.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
The students and I will go through a few micro bit tutorials together. "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is the first tutorial. If we have time to complete another one we will move to getting our micro bits to communicate.
