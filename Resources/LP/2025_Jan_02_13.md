# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Use the micro|bit to create a kinesthetic model of the solar system. Students will be given an example at the beginning and then be asked to make their own.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a scale?
What type of code allows a sensor to continually sense and record data?
If the sun was the size of a baseball on [teacher]â€™s desk, where would Neptune be?
## OBJECTIVES
Define and develop a scale model using ratios. 
Program a micro:bit to locate distances.
Discuss the size of the solar system based on the model.

## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
After a discussion about what scales and models are and what they are used for, students will watch the development of a basic model on a youtube video. This will provide them with the starting point of developing their own mode.
