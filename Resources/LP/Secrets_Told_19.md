## Lesson Plan
### Overview
Kids love to talk in code so parents and teachers can't figure out what they are saying. Enter the world of emojis and text acronyms such as "TBH" and "IDK." The codes can (and have been) broken. The history behind code is long and intricate. Below are examples of how code exists now and in the past.


### PRE/POST-TEST
1. The process of applying a cipher to some text is known as:
A. Plaintext
B. Encryption
C. Cipher
D. Defense


2. Which of the following are examples of the use of ciphers?
A. Browsing web
B. Credit/Debit card
C. Vehicle remotes
D. Integrity


3. True or False. Cipher text is text that has been encrypted.


### OBJECTIVES
TSW understand the concept of encryption.
TSW decode encrypted data.


### CATCH/HOOK
I'm Spilling the Tea!


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Ciphers are methods used to create code in two directions: Encrypt and Decode. If you are writing a code using Caesar Cipher, you place a value for each code between 1 and 25. Because there are 26 letters in the alphabet, creating messages using a Caesar Cipher can ensure that messages are encrypted and can't be understood by hackers.


For example: If I want to send you a message:  Good Morning! I could encrypt in with a value of 5. The message would come to you as: Ltti Rtwsnsl!. You would then decode it by counting back letters to the 5 value. If you wanted to send the message back to me, you would choose your own value. If you run out of letters, you simply wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet.


For this activity, I will give you a message that you have to encrypt and then messages that you have to decode. I will give you the value for each!


Encrypt:


1. This is cool! (value of 10)


2. It is like a different language. (value to 3)


3. I am enjoying this class. (value of 4)


4. Who knew this was a thing! (value of 2)


5. What does this have to do with cybersecurity? (value of 1)


Decode


1. K moqy tkijv! (value of 2)


2. Gsqtyxivmdih perkyeki (value of 4)


3. Qjfwsnsl fqty? (value of 5)


4. Wc. Ryvvoi uxog! (value of 10)


5. Qdydmr Frgh Wdonhuv (value of 3)




True Whispers: The Story of the Navajo Code Talkers Film


Background: Sending coded messages that cannot be easily decoded is vital to the secrecy of military operations. During WWII, the US Marine Corps enlisted Navajo volunteers to be “code talkers.” The “code talkers” sent military messages in their own language that was never broken, or decoded, by the Japanese.


 


Directions: Please answer the following questions in note-form as you watch the film. This will be turned in at the end of the class period, today.


1) Why were the Navajo teenagers eager and motivated to go to war?


 


2) In total, about how many Navajo became Code talkers?


 


3) Where were they deployed (sent) to aid Allied Forces?


 


4) About how many lives is it estimated that the Navajo Code talkers save throughout the war?


 


5) Why did it take so long for their contributions to be recognized by the nation?


 


6) Opinion: Do you think the American government should have recognized the Navajo Code Talkers as heroes when they returned from war? Explain based on your opinion.






### REVIEW
When creating methods of different coding, one can create a specific method that is used by only them. Many methods of coding exist and have existed for many years, long before it was a recognized method of communication. Can you think of other ways people have used codes to communicate?
