# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will learn the definition of input/output as it relates to computing and will use the Micro|bits to demonstrate various examples of inputs and outputs.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
In programming, what input would cause a computer to say Hello?
List examples of input devices.
List examples of output devices.
What is I/O?
The communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system is referred to as the ___________________
## OBJECTIVES
Define Input/output
Write a program for the micro:bit (input) that creates an output
Demonstrate the use of input to create an output


## CATCH/HOOK
Show video on Input and Output devices
 https://study.com/academy/lesson/i-o-control-methods-types-explanation.html
Hold up various items used for input and output and ask students to identify which they are?
Mouse, keyboard, screen, printer, stylus, etc

Whole Group - Teacher Led:
                          Start with Hook - Show the Youtube video on Input and Output devices
Individual - Students watch Edpuzzle over I/O and Micro:bits and answer questions 
                    https://edpuzzle.com/media/62d073d9fd26d740d9dd512c   
                    Learn about the Micro:bit  by navigating to the website: https://microbit- 
                    micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/io.html
Work in Pairs:
    Look at the Micro:bit and find each of the  input/output pins (or I/O pins for short)  0, 1, 2, 
    3V and GND
    Discuss what the V and the GND stand for
    USe https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/introduction/ as a resource
Whole Group - Teacher Led
    Reflect, answer questions
Teacher led and Work in Pairs
    Navigate to https://makecode.microbit.org/#
    Direct students to Start new Project
    Give Whole class instruction on Inputs....show examples
    Allow students time to work with Inputs (Button A pressed) and Output (Music Played)




 ** Optional - Have students hook up Microbit with speaker and download program to it

## REVIEW
What is an I/O?  (Input/Output)
Typing a computer program is input or output?  (Input)
Music playing through a speaker is input or output? (output)
The LED lights on a Micro:bit are input or output? (output)
The pins (0,1, 2, 3) on the Micro:bit are input or output? (input)
Pushing the button A on the Micro:bit is input or output? (input)
Your computer monitor is input or output? (output)
