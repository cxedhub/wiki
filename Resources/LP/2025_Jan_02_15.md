# Lesson Plan
## Overview
In this lesson, students will be teaching a robot about handwashing. They will be introduced to the vocabulary term algorithm and be asked to write an algorithm to teach a robot to wash its hands. They will then make changes to their algorithms as necessary.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Why is hand-washing important?
What steps would you need to teach someone else how to wash his or her hands?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to explain why handwashing is important in maintaining personal health, reducing health risks, and preventing the spread of disease.  They create a set of steps (an algorithm) for washing hands.  After receiving peer feedback, they will refine their algorithms to improve the process.


## CATCH/HOOK
I will introduce a robot friend of mine (a cutout, picture, etc.).  I will then ask students, “What are some important  things I can teach my robot?” “Should I teach my robot to wash her hands? Why?” After allowing students to turn and talk and discussing answers, say, “My robot is like a computer.  She can’t think about how to do something by herself.  I have to show her how!”


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
I will introduce a robot friend of mine (a cutout, picture, etc.).  I will then ask students, “What are some important  things I can teach my robot?” “Should I teach my robot to wash her hands? Why?” After allowing students to turn and talk and discussing answers, say, “My robot is like a computer.  She can’t think about how to do something by herself.  I have to show her how!”




1. Today, we are going to write a set of directions to teach our robots how to wash their hands.  A set of steps needed to complete a task is called an algorithm (write algorithm on the board).
2. I will start my algorithm by asking a question.  Do I need to wash my hands?  This is a conditional.  That is where I will begin my algorithm.  I will model that on the board. after writing my name in the upper right hand corner.
3. Students will then turn and talk about the rest of the steps required to wash hands.  When they have finished, discuss sequencing, conditionals, and repetition.  Can they provide any examples of those ideas in hand washing?
4. Students will then be asked to write at least 5 steps in an algorithm that outlines the steps involved in hand washing.  If they finish early, they can begin drawing a picture of their robot friend.  
5. When all students are finished, they will exchange directions with a partner.  Students will read through their partner’s algorithm and have a conversation about things their partner did well and one step their partners could add to the algorithm. 
6. As a whole group, ask students what steps the can add.  Also discuss the importance of improving algorithms because that’s where great learning happens.
7. Students will then be given time, independently, to improve their algorithms by adding any steps they need.

## REVIEW
An algorithm is a set of steps needed to complete a task.  Today, we created an algorithm to teach our robots how to wash their hands because hand-washing keeps us healthy!
