# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students spend several periods looking at the development of communication over the past 200 years.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What is a micro:bit?
How does hardware know what to do?
How does information get from a computer to a micro:bit?
How did technology change communication?
<Cut & Paste activity>
## OBJECTIVES
Explain how technology has changed communication
Describe how information is transferred between pieces of hardware


## CATCH/HOOK
Have students explain how to get information from Wyoming to California quickly using only technology available at the beginning of the 1800s. As they start talking- explain that modern options were not available.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students spend a couple of days practicing morse code, using micro:bits, and Micro:Chat.
