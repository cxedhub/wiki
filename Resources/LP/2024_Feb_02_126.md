# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students will work independently to design a ‘driving base’ using the SPIKE
PRIME LEGO sets. Upon completion of the base students will develop the code to drive the base around the LEGO SuperPowered map. Students will have to problem solve to find errors in code and re-program their driving bases to allow their model to follow the most accurate and direct path around the map.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students will work independently to design a ‘driving base’ using the SPIKE
PRIME LEGO sets. Upon completion of the base students will develop the code to drive the base around the LEGO SuperPowered map. Students will have to problem solve to find errors in code and re-program their driving bases to allow their model to follow the most accurate and direct path around the map.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Pre-Questions
1. Looking at your rule book, identity missions that could be solved with the coding skills
learned in this lesson/project
2. What do you know about energy?
3. What are resources available to you that could help you learn more about different
energy sources and their uses in various parts of the world?
4. How could stopping a motor help you solve a mission with your robot?


Post Questions
1. What ‘Innovation Project’ ideas do the mission models spark?
2. What are the pros and cons of the different parts of the white energy journey?
## OBJECTIVES
● Work as a team to learn how to connect and use the sensors and motors contained in
the LEGO SPIKE PRIME building sets
● Build a simple driving base using LEGO ® SPIKE PRIME materials
● Explain and describe their models before and after construction
● Draw or sketch their models prior to beginning construction
● Design model changes to make the driving base more effective, faster, or accurate and
record changes in their Engineering Notebook
● Describe and make connections from the mission models to the ‘White Energy Journey
Project SPARK’ ideas


## CATCH/HOOK
Students will enter the room to 4 tables, or stations. On each station, there will be a LEGO SPIKE set with bags of LEGO’s on the tables. On the SmartBoard (located in the front of the room) will be introductory videos playing from the LEGO Education YouTube account.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Background Information
Students should have some information and background knowledge of natural resources and energy needs around the world. They need to know that renewable energy comes from energy sources found in our world that will never run out.


Class Discussion Prompts:
1. What is renewable energy?
2. What types of renewable energy can we use in our community/state?
3. What types of renewable energy exist in other areas of the world?
4. What technologies exist that allow us to capture and store energy from these renewable
resources?
5. What are some technologies that we could develop to harness these energies in the
future?
Teacher Duty/Task-Before the Activity
1. Prior to this activity the teacher should ensure the FIRST LEGO ® League YouTube
channel is pulled up on the classroom screen (SmartBoard, Promethean, etc.)
2. Ensure all students have their own copies of the FIRST LEGO League Challenge
Engineering Notebook
3. Ensure all students have access to a personal device to use for coding their robot and
one additional device to follow project directions and record their project work.
4. Ensure all students have an account and can access the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime app(TM)
5. The night before, make sure all controllers and devices are plugged in and charging
6. Guiding question/Essential Question: “ Think about how a sensor could be helpful to get
the robot to stop in the right place to engage with a mission model on the mat”


During Lesson-With the Students (1-2 hour session)
1. Have students access the FIRST LEGO ® League Challenge videos on the FIRST LEGO ®
League YouTube Channel
2. After videos, have each student individually read pages 3-9 in their Engineering
Notebooks on how the LEGO Challenge works (10-15 minutes)
3. After videos and reading, have students open the SPIKE (TM) Prime app (this should
already be downloaded, or added, and ready for them to use) and go to Lesson 1
4. Students should identify the missions that could be solved with the coding skills learned
in the lesson. Have students record their own ideas in their Engineering Notebook.
5. Students should use digital building instructions from books 4, 7, and 8 and models in
bags 4, 7, and 8 from the Challenge set.
6. Determine code and building skills that students can apply in the Robot Game
7. After construction, students should place their models on the mat and show how thor
models work and see if they can use their code to drive the robot to one of the mission
models.

## REVIEW
After construction and coding of the robots, students should place their models on the mat and show how their models work and see if they can use their code to drive the robot to one of the mission models.
Students should gather data from various trials to determine which 'code' is the most accurate for the desired movement of their model.
Students should collaborate through moderated discussion to trouble-shoot errors/issues and determine fixes to their robot or code to attempt during the next practice session.
