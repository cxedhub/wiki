title: Explore Block Programming with Free Scratch
description: Students are introduced to block programing for the first time and are given several sets of tasks to complete to show that they were able to follow directions an able to customize their program to their individual taste. They enter a competition periodically perhaps  every fourth or fifth period to select the top programs from the class by demonstrating to another elementary class.

# OVERVIEW
## Activity Overview:  
Students are introduced to block programing for the first time and are given several sets of tasks to complete to show that they were able to follow directions an able to customize their program to their individual taste. They enter a competition periodically perhaps  every fourth or fifth period to select the top programs from the class by demonstrating to another elementary class.

# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Students are introduced to block programing for the first time and are given several sets of tasks to complete to show that they were able to follow directions an able to customize their program to their individual taste. They enter a competition periodically perhaps  every fourth or fifth period to select the top programs from the class by demonstrating to another elementary class.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Use 'None' if you do not have answer.
1. Name the program that you have done coding in to date?
2. What is a 'conditional choice' in programing? You may use None also.
3. Where can you save your program in Scratch? Computer; Cloud; Flash-Drive; in your memory?
4. Before you started Scratch, do you think you would enjoy 'programming'?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to use and do the following:
1. Student create an interactive program using cue cards but are able to customize it to their choice. 
2. Share with one another with out coping.


## CATCH/HOOK
How would you like to make your own personal MUSIC, VIDEO, GAME, Etc?


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Scratch Cards for Students found free at the following location =
https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/cards/en/scratch-cards-all.pdf 
(large file pdf - 10.6MB) 


It is best if you log in as a teacher before downloading the pdf file of Scratch Cards for Students. They need to be printed in color and assembled together in groups for each student. Students doing sound should bring a set of ear plugs for listening to their output.
A student takes a set and uses the cards to make their unique Scratch Program along the lines of the new output that is demonstrated in the set of cards. The visual, auditor, motion or whatever is different for each student as their design is along the lines of the suggested set of cards but they have individual unique choices as to the particular output.

## REVIEW
Check you spreadsheet to see who has not finished all the Scratch Flash Card Sets.
