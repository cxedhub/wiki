# Lesson Plan
## Overview
Using a Scratch Jr. activity, students will program different counter sprites to move into a ten frame. The purpose of this activity is to integrate the math skill of adding and subtracting within 20 with the programing of a control sequence in computer science.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
Can the student show adding and subtracting within 20 using Scratch Jr.?
## OBJECTIVES
Students will be able to add and subtract within 20 using counter sprites while using a control sequence in the programming language.


## CATCH/HOOK
There are many ways to show adding and subtracting within 20. I like using Scratch Jr. to show how I add and subtract within 20.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Students will need one to one iPad devices.


Before Activity


Projected on white board, show students the teacher version of the counters and ten frame. 
Review different addition and subtraction problems with a ten frame.
Choose a math problem and show them how to use the text feature on Scratch Jr. Have one number be one color (blue) and the other number a different color (red) and the product be black. Ask them if they could change the counter sprites to match the number color. Ask them the types of blocks they might use to put the counter sprites into the ten frame.
What problems do they think they will come across? 
Remind them that they aren’t using their finger to move the sprite.
Show them one example with the counter 1 sprite. Work together as a class to get the counter 2 sprite in the ten frame. 


During Activity


Remind them that they aren’t using their finger to move the sprite.
Allow students to work together to problem solve.


Post Activity
Ask them what math problem they used?
Ask them the types of blocks they used to move the counter sprites?
What problems did they  come across? 
I use a lot of screen sharing in this process so the kids can see what other kids did.

## REVIEW
What worked well? What could you change? Could you use different sprits as the counters?
