# Lesson Plan
## Overview
This activity focuses on creating a following an algorithm to solve a problem. Using a white shower curtain liner, draw a grid. Place toys in some grids. Using algorithms, the teacher will guide the student through the grid.
## ASSESSMENT PRE/POST-TEST
What do we need to do to get through the grid?
## OBJECTIVES
Follow an algorithm
create an algorithm


## CATCH/HOOK
Students see the grid with toys placed in some squares. Squares that have the word 'start' and 'finish'.


## ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Place the grid on the floor, get toys and put them in some of the grid boxes. There is also a 'start' box and a 'finish box'. Discuss that we are going to be explorers today. We need to get through the maze in order to make it safely to the other side. Explain that you will give them an algorithm to follow in order to make it through the maze. Review that an algorithm is steps to follow to solve the problem. The students take turns starting on the 'start' box. The teacher gives directions by showing arrows and stating the direction (example: Hold up a picture of an arrow pointing straight. say 'move one box forward') Continue until each child has a chance to maneuver the maze. Play several times, then allow the students to come up with the algorithm that will get them through the maze, keeping the path the same until they have mastered the concept. This activity should be completed over several days so as not to overwhelm the students.
