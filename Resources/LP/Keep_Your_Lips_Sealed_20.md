## Lesson Plan
### Overview
There are multiple ways to gain information. Many people will openly provide information with minimal thought to how the information can be used maliciously.


### PRE/POST-TEST
1. Which of the following is considered confidential information?
A. Social Security number
B. Birthdate
C. Eye color
D. Medical records
E. Height
F. Work email address


2. The definition of confidentiality is:
A. the state of being whole and undivided.
B. whether or not data or a system is actually available for use.
C. any information that should be kept private and secure.
D. an algorithm that converts plain messages into encrypted messages.


3. True or False. People rarely give unsecure information when asked.


### OBJECTIVES
TSW describe ways people can use information maliciously.
TSW explain examples of breeches of confidentiality.
TSW create a system to gain information from random indivduals.


### CATCH/HOOK
Share or Not to Share...That is the question.


### ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS
Discussion Board:
What are some organizations or people that are required to provide confidentiality? Why? What can happen if they do not provide the required confidentiality?


Hackers and identity thieves can come up with clever ways to get information about you. For example, what is your SuperHero name? Watch this:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkvuN-CwTTU 


See how it tells you to post your SuperHero name in the comments? That's how it starts. Something super simple and then can go into different things.


For this activity, create your own way to gain information about people. It can be gaining their birth month, birth day, address, school, grade, etc.






### REVIEW
Confidentiality
Confidentiality means that any information that should be kept private and secure, is protected by all individuals and organizations.


What information needs to stay confidential?


**Passwords


**Personally identifiable information such as Social Security number, birthday, phone number, and address.


**Private information such as phone logs, texts messages, private/direct messages, email address and emails, and personal websites.


NEVER put passwords on sticky notes or written down in an obvious or public place. Think of it like keeping a spare key under a doormat. That is the first place burglars will look in order to gain entry into your home.


ALWAYS stay alert and aware on the Internet. If it looks fishy, treat it as such. Do Not open emails from people you don't know or from organizations that you are not familiar with.
