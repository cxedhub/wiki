<h2>💡 Custom Professional Development: Integrating Computing Where It Belongs</h2>
<p>Looking to bring computing into your classrooms in a way that feels natural, relevant, sustainable, and aligned to your state, district, or other standards/requirements? We design <strong>custom professional development (PD)</strong> that empowers educators to integrate computing concepts into <strong>the subjects they already teach</strong>—from K–12 to higher ed.</p>
<p><strong>We meet educators where they are—whether they’re new to computing or already weaving it into their practice—and we help them build confidence and capacity without adding to their already full plates.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>🧩 Our Focus: Computing + Your Content</strong></h3>
<p>We don’t believe in “one more thing.” Our <strong>Computing + X</strong> approach is rooted in the idea that computing can and should be <strong>woven into existing learning spaces.</strong> Whether it’s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing algorithms in a <strong>language arts</strong> class,</li>
  <li>Exploring data analysis in <strong>social studies</strong>,</li>
  <li>Modeling systems in <strong>science</strong>, or</li>
  <li>Using creative coding in <strong>mathematics</strong>—</li>
</ul>
<p>We show educators how computing can deepen learning, enhance engagement, and expand possibilities.</p>

<h3>What We Customize</h3>
<p>Every school and district is different—so we co-create experiences that reflect your unique needs. Some of what we offer includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In-person or virtual workshops</strong> that align with your goals and schedule</li>
  <li><strong>Grade-band or content-area specific sessions</strong> (K–2, 3–5, middle, high school, or beyond)</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-on curriculum planning</strong> that integrates computing into current lessons</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative coaching or classroom modeling</strong> to support real-time application</li>
  <li><strong>Follow-up touchpoints</strong> to sustain growth and impact</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you're launching a new initiative or deepening existing work, we’ll partner with you to make computing integration meaningful and achievable.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant to your context</strong></p>
<p><strong>Actionable from day one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supportive of long-term instructional change</strong></p>
